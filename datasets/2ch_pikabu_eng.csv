" Take, for example, Russia, Western European countries and the United States. There is a crossbreeding, a conscious policy of replacing the white population with an alien black and brown. A new mestizo race is being created, Islamization and blackening. In large cities, half of the population come from ebony in Mexico, Africa, the Middle East, and in the case of Russia, the Caucasus and Central Asia. Ethnic-Arab ghetto niggas believe in the laws they want dick, monstrous scale ethnic crime. It is impossible to talk about migration, and even more so to address the issue of the replacement of the indigenous population by the authorities; Freedom of speech is not here for you, young man. At the same time, it is possible to say that White should die out, and this is normal. White officially dies out propaganda is being conducted in one way or another aimed at reducing the birth rate of the white population. Feminism, LGBT, childfree. Every woman in Sweden is a left-liberal feminist, a country of victorious feminism. What happens there today is terribly done. Mixed marriages, interracial marriages are promoted, the superiority of mestizo children is promoted. There is a demonization of whites and propaganda of the superiority of black and dark-skinned men, force relations, a white woman, a dark-skinned black male migrant. As a result, there are more and more inkwells, more and more mixed marriages, more and more non-white mestizos. White women simply do not want to contact the men of their nation and race, endowing them with the worst qualities and deifying blacks. Moreover, most whites do not consider the supply of chocks to be something bad, on the contrary, they are tolerant of them. A policy of promoting tolerance, multiculturalism, political correctness and cosmopolitanism is being pursued. SJW is gaining popularity even in Russia - this is generally a separate topic for discussion. All of the above applies to once the strongest countries, former empires, bending down the weak. Today it happens that the former empires literally degrade, degenerate and die out, and those who were once colonized take the place of the once strongest dominant peoples. In France, by 2080, Negroes and Arabs will already dominate, in Russia - Caucasians and immigrants from Central Asia, in Great Britain - Indians, Negroes, Arabs, Pakistanis, etc. And in small, neutral countries, like Slovenia or Belarus, Lithuania or the Czech Republic, Romania or Estonia, everything is in a bundle. They do not face extinction, they remain and will remain white. Moreover, they have a policy aimed at preserving the traditional values ​​and culture of the indigenous population. They said no to the refugees. In Poland, for example, it is much easier for a Russian or a Ukrainian to move and stay than an Arab or an African. In Germany, the situation is the opposite, they are not waiting for whites there. Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, BiH, Montenegro, Macedonia, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia - these are Europe of the future. Scandinavia, southern and western Europe, as well as Russia, will lose their indigenous population and their culture. ",0

" Schizophasia (speech disruption) is a symptom of mental disorders expressed in violation of the structure of speech, in which, unlike speech incoherence (a stream of unconnected words), phrases are constructed correctly 1, however, they do not carry any semantic load, and the content of the speech corresponds to the content of delirium 2. This speech disorder reflects the fragmented thinking of patients 3. This disorder is characteristic primarily for schizophrenia. The concept of schizophasia was introduced by E. Kraepelin in 1913 and for some time it was considered a special form of schizophrenia 4. Some authors even distinguish a separate form of schizophrenia with the same name 3. Schizophasia is characterized by increased speech activity, speech pressure, as well as a monologue symptom characterized by speech inexhaustibility and lack of need for an interlocutor 4. As a rule, this symptom is combined with external orderliness, accessibility for communication, and relative intellectual and affective safety of patients 4. A distinctive feature of schizophasia is the predominant production of morphemic word formations and glossomaniacal statements 5. In addition to the paranoid form of schizophrenia 4, it can occur with severe dementia 6. ",0

The draft law of 213 accreditation is aimed at expanding the existing state law and will allow rural residents to go to school for a little more than 14 years of age. This measure, supported by the deputy of the Assembly, Alexey Hansen, will provide this privilege to students, regardless of where their school is located. This means that 14-year-old children can go to schools soon, which do not provide buses to students, even in such large neighborhoods as Washo and Clark. Drivers of the state of Nevada may already be entitled to 15.5 years of age, provided that they are brought home by car, 21 years old and less.

" Well, let's take a look at everything you wrote. Fuck, do you really think you're better than fuckers? Well, in general, everything that lives in a rash is affected by govnomidas, but no one here recognizes this. Now they bring up a lot of good coders. In the next thread they pissed already. Go streamline. You are humiliating Russian children at school. I studied in a school and we had a class that consisted of only little rusachki. Do you think something has changed? Chocks you shit in the ass flooded and forced little mermaids in the classroom nightmare omezhnykh little mercenaries? I do not like to use Natsik phrases, but for centuries you really just sat in the mountains and fucked rams, even you fagot people could capture you. Poor you know the story. When Rusnya came to the Caucasus, everything was already divided by the Ottomans and Persians. And then RI fucked the Persians and constantly attacked the Ottomans, sucking the reasons out of her finger, in principle, little Rusyks, what else could I expect from them. In the past, you (Chechens, Dagi, and other sorts) were just savages ... And if we talk about the Central Asians who have been bugging since the occupation, then you were ordinary poor nomads Another act of ignorance of history. For example, Caucasians in fact the peoples responsible for the ethnogenesis of the Dag and Azeri already had Derbent, and the little rusachki did not even have plans. Read the history of the Caucasus and Central Asia, there were local empires and bends of the okrug and so on and so forth. They call Russian fagots, Slavshchit. You say it like it’s something bad. I have po poles known as irl, who are Russian and who piss on Rus with an even bigger belfry than I am. Now everyone is afraid of you because if the fagot makes a couple of holes in you, protecting himself, then they will put him on the bottle, and if you kill the fagot , then you will not be fucking. Maybe because in a rashka it’s exceeding the limits of self-defense to wet a person who goes at you with fists from the wave of a knife? Who is to blame for the fact that Rusnya is so degenerate that one Chechen goner kneels a group of little russians? Do you think that if the Rusny gopota is less degenerate, then people also didn’t have nightmares? Who is to blame for freezing you up or giving them a bite when you see how your Slavic friend is being humiliated? Why, there, remember that rally, where a little Zhirik put some guy on his knees and everyone is standing around and taking off, like a herd of Rusny rams. I give a tooth, in that crowd stood his friends and acquaintances. Personally for me it’s fucked up, I especially lose when there’s not some kind of brother-wrestler, but a Chechen smarchek. I would never leave or leave my friend in such a fucking place and it doesn’t matter which nation was a friend and which attacker. Your whole problem is not that you are weak, not that the majority of little russians like a pig like a fuck, not that for a thousand years of existence they could not build a normal civilization and were not given to others. The problem is the ordinary mistake of the survivor, you see the Caucasian cattle redneck, because it is on average stronger, more assertive, more aggressive and the image of a Caucasian as a person who is a danger is burned in your brain, while you don’t want to notice that you have whole cities full by Rusny AUEshniki, because one average Rusny Gopnik ayushnik bydloyd sucks from one average Churkobessky Gopnik bydloyd. In the end, Rusachkov in the village of Kushchevskaya fucked who? Other little girls. Who came to the school and chose loli for fucking? Other little girls. Who burned the little rusachkov?

You file the case as if Vladimir Solovyov is just a star of show business, like the American Oprah. He earns a lot, so he can buy his own home anywhere. This is not true. Soloviev is a state propagandist on state television. Now he is everywhere and does not crawl out of the screen, not because he is talented, but because the country has a TV monopoly of the state. Solovyov is ready to lie more than others, and they keep him on the screen. There would be real competition between talk shows and their television hosts, Solovyov would be where he belongs - a third-rate radio host. What he actually was before all the real stars of talk shows from our television were not expelled, and their programs were not closed for reasons of censorship. Maxim, you are talking about the ratings and profits that Solovyov brings to Russia-1 channel, and I look at the budget table of our country and see that Russia-1 is deeply unprofitable. Every year receives a budget subsidy. 24.6 billion rubles last year. 24 BILLION, Maxim. That would be enough to pay for all sick children in the country. But it took all the nightingale's fees, and then turned into villas on the Italian lake of Como. So it does not bring Solovyov. And all of us - taxpayers - (and you too, Maxim) bring money into his pocket. And I do not want to pay for the luxurious Italian life of this liar, the hypocrite and the bastard.

" The number of prostitutes in Israel continues to increase Last week, a report was presented during the annual conference on women at the Shechter Institute for Jewish Studies in Jerusalem, which described sexual exploitation in Israel. According to this report, according to The Jerusalem Post, at present about 14 thousand people are involved in prostitution in Israel, 95 of them are women. It is especially noted that approximately 3,000 of them are minors. Researchers concluded that the age of the first experience of prostitution in some 13 years. Again, as in previous studies, it is noted that many prostitutes experienced sexual abuse in childhood. The report said that only 20 prostitutes ultimately succeed in independently ceasing to trade in their bodies. If the data provided in the report are correct, then over the past two to three years, the number of prostitutes in Israel has increased by 14. Earlier, the editorial board of NEWSru.co.il published data from the 2016 National Prostitution Survey in Israel, according to which about 12 thousand people (95 women, 11 minors) were engaged in prostitution in Israel at that time. According to this study, 43 prostitutes were born in Israel, 52 are former natives of the countries of the former USSR. Moreover, 86 prostitutes are Jewish, 97 are Israeli citizens. 62 prostitutes have children. 81 of them have children under 18 years old. 25 prostitutes serve more than seven clients per day. 66 women claim to have come to prostitution due to a difficult financial situation. 7 because of drugs. Over 80 prostitutes claim to be harassed (physical or verbal) by clients. 76 people involved in prostitution say they would like to do other work. Recall that on December 31, 2018 in the second and third reading, the Knesset approved a bill banning the purchase of prostitute services. This was one of the last laws passed by the Knesset of the 20th convocation. The bill was filed by Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked. The law will enter into force in July 2020. Under this law, acquiring sex services and staying in a place where such services are provided will be considered a criminal offense. The fine for acquiring sex services will be 2.000 shekels for the first violation and 4.000 for the repeated violation. In some cases, the prosecutor's office may charge a criminal offense, and then the maximum fine will be up to 75.300 shekels. In addition, police officers will be able to issue a fine to all those present at the crime scene, without having to clarify the circumstances of their presence in the place intended for the purchase of sex services. A survey conducted by our editorial staff in 2017 showed that most of our readers support the legalization of prostitution in Israel and do not support the initiative to punish clients of prostitutes. Moreover, this attitude to the problem of prostitution remains unchanged for many years. ",0

" More than one and a half thousand people became victims of illegal online broadcasts from hotel rooms in South Korea. It is reported by CNN with reference to the local police. The cameras were hidden in set-top boxes, outlets, and hair dryer holders. Footage was uploaded to a special site. More than four thousand people were registered on the portal. 97 of them paid a monthly fee of $ 45 (almost three thousand rubles). For an extra charge, users could connect to the stream live. Several people participated in the criminal scheme: two men have already been arrested, and two others are under investigation. It was established that hotel employees did not know anything about the criminal scheme. In the past, there was a similar case when illegal cameras were installed in hotels and they were constantly secretly watched, but the police first discovered a situation where the video is broadcast live on the Internet, the law enforcement authorities specified. Illegally filmed videos are a common problem in South Korea. Most often, attackers mount hidden cameras in public women's toilets. This genre is called spycam, records are later sold online. In 2018, tens of thousands of women took to the streets of Seoul and other cities in protest of such crimes. Performances were held under the slogan My life is not your porn. Previously, the owner of a major South Korean porn site, known as Song, was sentenced to four years in prison. Its portal hosted thousands of spycam records. ",0

Apparently, schoolmoders themselves sympathize with Nazism and turn a blind eye to this. 21 threads After I threatened him with a report, this time Mamkin’s fascist, removes the line about the hero and for some reason puts a Nazi salutation of the SS Galichin’s division instead.

" Plus are obvious: - a good, stable salary First of all, s n in fagotugriks, not money. Since 2013, the military began to receive 2 times less. For risk to life and discomfort - a grade-level cleaner cleaner fee in Alabama. - social package, preferential housing Social package of the type of vacation at fidget resorts. With the corresponding contingent (the same warriors, plane men and state employees). Preferential housing in trash bins. Do not take your house or apartment in stalin on a military mortgage. - early retirement This is the only plus. But, firstly, believe me, the state will take care that by the age of 40 you have little left. And secondly, it’s good to be a clerk at the headquarters, a dog handler, a passportist, etc., for those who do not go under bullets. - respect from society, respect from decent people. Right now, I should worry about respect from fagot from cattle surveillance, lol. And this is only a small number of cons. More about them: - Remote units and garrisons. Breathing in hours beyond the Arctic Circle, in the midst of all kinds of forests and in small provincial towns, where to do the fuck. While your peers live in DS2, in relative civilization, you freeze at -30 and buy tomatoes for 300 rubles. - Uncomfortable conditions of service. The technique is designed so that you would like to quickly die in battle, the shape is an uncomfortable bag, if you want convenience - buy your berets, your T-shirts, etc. Office chairs are the cheapest, hemorrhoids and scoliosis will come soon. The commanders were beaten off tightly, for one normal officer there were 10 inhumane bastards who milked money and resources of both conscripts and fellow officers. - Probability to die. And it’s okay for a just cause, but in fact you’ll die in yet another Syria, as a vacation vacation ticket. The family will be thrown for payments and ordered to remain silent. - Mutual responsibility. Soldiers and officers regularly steal some crap, such as robberies, drunken fights, rape. They can only be punished if the victim has connections higher than their roof. You will have to look at all this and serve you with these people. As a result, after 20 years of service, we get a dull-infantile fagot, incapable of anything except guarding Pyaterochka's parking school, or, at best, membership in another organized crime group consisting of security officers.

" English scientists at the SRUC Midlotian Pig Research Center use face recognition technology to assess the emotional state of pigs, reports The Daily Mail. The study is supported by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), as well as precision animal husbandry experts. Scientists want to understand by the expression of their faces whether the pig is happy with everything and whether it is sick. In the future, on the basis of this study, they will create a tool that will control facial expressions in pigs and warn farmers of any health problems. smi2 Hot tea is deadly The dog was waiting for the owners in the country, but they never arrived (photo) Sea fish began to be caught in Russian rivers Early detection of pig health problems gives farmers the potential to improve the condition of animals, makes it possible to quickly solve any problems and apply individual treatment for individuals, explains Dr. Emma Baxter of SRUC. As previous studies have shown, pigs have very expressive faces. They can signal their intentions to other pigs. It is also proven that they use different grimaces for pain and stress. In their project, scientists make three-dimensional and two-dimensional images of a population of breeding sows. A group of animals is in typical situations that can lead to various emotional states. They can demonstrate various grimaces associated with pain, and after eating, on the contrary, they look calm and contented. The resulting images are processed at the Bristol Center of the University of Western England. Various machine learning methods are created here to automatically identify the entire spectrum of emotions conveyed by certain facial expressions. By focusing on the face, we hope to create an animal-centered methodology for assessing the general condition. This will make it possible to understand both short-term emotional reactions and long-term individual moods of animals, said Dr. Emma Baxter. After testing the methods, the team will develop the technology for use on farms. It is assumed that individual sows in large herds will be constantly monitored with this new tool. Our work has already demonstrated 97 accuracy in pig recognition. Face recognition technology makes it possible to implement inexpensive, inconspicuous and practical means for biometric identification of individual animals on the farm. Our next step will be to use trained algorithms to automatically recognize expressions related to underlying emotional states such as happiness or suffering, explained Professor Melvin Smith of the Bristol Robotics Laboratory. Earlier it became known that in China, a local engineer built a mini-shelter for cats, which is equipped with a face recognition system. ",0

In the Russian Empire, some minorities stupidly taught their native language for decades under the light of a lantern at night, because the performance would be suicidal and would only have resulted in the deaths of the best people and exile to Siberia, as was the case 2 times with Polish uprisings. People just waited for their time FOR YEARS, strengthening the base and getting ready. Zhirdyay did a useful job - he muddied up the first Russian nationalism, digestible for intellectuals (and not just for the shaved-headed proletariat with Germanophilia), which has become truly popular and discussed among young people. Now here's another shkolota pulled through memes. And you want all these people to fling a major at the kukan? Such a crap only a provocateur can wipe, scrape. In the current conditions, it is necessary to engage in the popularization of ideas, which is happening successfully. Everything else is tantamount to a suicidal attack by a handful of many partisans on the state, which will end only in the death of the partisans themselves or life sentences for them. ",1

" No, perhaps I will answer more fully. Imagine being robbed. You go to the private police, put the grandmother on the table, talk about what happened. The police are investigating the incident as much as they can. They give you a list of potential criminals, most likely from one person. You come to a man, say so and so, man, I suspect you, I want to sue. If he also wants to sue, then he goes with you to the court of your choice. If you don’t want to, then you turn to the court with your evidence base, he comes to the person and turns out with a similar phrase: you, a citizen of such-and-such, are accused of such and such. Come with us to the courtroom for proceedings, or we, according to the article of such and such current legislation, have the right to punish you. If a person agrees, then you are suing. If he is guilty, then he is sentenced and he pays the costs of the court, if not, then you pay the costs of the court and go to look for the criminal further with the help of the private police. Sounds fucked how bad, huh? Well, the MARKET SOLVES so that everything works much more efficiently. Instead of going to a private police bureau, you are likely to take insurance from one or more of them in case of offenses applied in your direction. For them, the profit is that they will consistently receive money from you, for you - that you can sleep peacefully. Private policemen themselves already enter into contracts with the courts in order to avoid anal fuck with your going back and forth, in return they themselves go about the alleged criminals and offer them to go to court. The most efficient courts and policemen will remain on the market itself, because nobody will want to bring in money to the ineffective. The question remains: what is your profit to go to court if you have not offended a fly in life, except to avoid punishment, which you do not deserve? And even this solves the markets, because, obviously, the courts that compensate or even encourage you to go to them, even if you are innocent, will look more attractive. I hope I answered the question. By the way, venal courts will not be popular just because of their venality, because only the seeker gets the benefit from it, and then only when they file a lawsuit for nothing. And the state will not grow out of the courts just because the courts themselves will not possess weapons, they will be possessed by policemen. Well, competition, again. Appeals should be filed with higher courts, which will work on the same principles. ",0

" the writings indicate that Ssakolov didn’t really mention, and no one mentioned the blockade’s influence and Alex’s intention to dissolve Bonya from 1801. And not a word about the articles in Napoleon’s magazine. But you could mention that there is nothing there (if there really was nothing there). and it’s even shown that Ssakolov thought differently If you are talking about the Napoleon’s Army, and the emphasis on the Spanish War, then if you look at the text in full, then we are talking about the reasons for participating in the Napoleonic Wars in general, and not just about the events after the outbreak of the war in Spain. We have no opportunity to analyze the whole complex spectrum of Russian-French relations in 1809-1812, however, it should be noted that it was the war in Spain, which finally made the British cabinet irreconcilable and provoked the war of 1809, that greatly influenced the position of Alexander I on relation to Napoleon. It is known that the king disliked the crowned soldier, whose glory was envious of black envy. The war of Father Alexander, Emperor Paul I, against France, the Directory still fully fit into the line of wars of monarchical states against revolutionary infection. Moreover, the Emperor Knight acted as the most sincere and consistent conductor of this line. Realizing that the British and Austrian cabinets were guided more by mercenary considerations than the desire to save monarchical principles, Pavel left the game, not allowing more blood to be shed by Russian soldiers for interests foreign to the country. On the contrary, Alexander fought in the name of very strange principles, far from the interests of the Russian people and even the Russian monarchy. It seems to us that no one could formulate the motives of his behavior as accurately as the outstanding Russian historian Nikolai Ivanovich Ulyanov: The fanaticism of this mysterious hatred has long been noted in historical literature and there are many attempts to explain it. The most unfortunate one that proceeds from the economic and political interests of Russia. Russia had no real reason to participate in the Napoleonic wars. The European fight did not concern her, and Napoleon had no reason to conquer Russia. Behave calmly, do your own thing, no one would touch her finger. No more convincing is another point of view explaining the wars of Russia with the Directory and Bonapartist France by the reactionary inclinations of the Russian tsars. Only the war of Paul I could come under such an interpretation, and even then with difficulty. Alexander, on the other hand, looked less like a fighter against revolutionary infection; even before he entered the throne, he struck foreigners with indignant speeches against despotism and worship of the ideas of freedom, law and justice. Of course, the price of his liberalism is known, and it is hardly necessary to object to those historians who considered him a mask, but such a mask is suitable for anything, but not for the fight against revolution. More truly, he did not have any principles or beliefs. The fatal war in faraway Spain, where the color of the Napoleonic army was dying, gave Alexander the hope to take revenge for the Austerlitz defeat, the defeat at Friedland and the Tilsit peace. Therefore, without counterarguments from Ssakolov, Yuspaninin still looks frankly weak. And now it’s clear why the court did not take her into account and is unlikely to accept it during the appeals process, so that Ssakolov will be ruined. The legend is fresh ... Yes, then they still found the text completely and it turned out that Chudinov praised Podmazo for refuting all Ebzhen’s fabrications. ",1

" In any totalitarian state, the basis is the retention of power by the leader of the state for a maximum period, initially hiding under the law, then changing it under the pretext of the aspirations of the masses. Subsequently, the deformed legislation, together with the untwisted flywheel of contrived articles, begins to destroy all, sometimes its own creators. The manic desire to remain in power and the panicky fear of a conspiracy among dissatisfied comrades-in-arms encouraged Stalin to remove all the most authoritative and thinking people in power as potential competitors. Only slabbers remained, wagging their asses and pleasantly looking into the leader’s eyes, even when they planted and killed their family members. There are thousands of such examples, and the created repressive harvester mowed down indiscriminately, some of the leader’s comrades-in-arms escaped from the country, others remained, believing that their authority and merits to the homeland would protect against punishment, but both of them miscalculated. My great-grandfather, a priest of a small church after the communists closed it, went home at the request of believers, baptized communion, and so on. He was arrested under article 58: agitation against the Soviet regime and shot 4 days later. The family hoped for many years that he was in prison, as they had been lied to in the NKVD. What real danger did he pose for Soviet power in the year 37? It is clear that the person was killed just for reporting, in order to report to the top that the work to identify enemies is being carried out successfully and there are enemies. Subsequently, the system also took revenge on the mustachioed when he lay in a puddle of urine for several hours without help, and his party comrades, either out of fear or for other reasons, were not interested in his long absence. Khrushchov also finished the same way, at first dancing hopak on booze at the whim of Stalin, then deciding to get even for all the humiliations with a report at the Twentieth Congress. The top, fearing the emergence of a new dictator, quietly removed him until he gained authority. Of course, they did not begin to apologize for the repressions, they said that it was just a mistake that came out, with whom it does not happen! They don’t take offense at the Party! (A popular phrase at that time). In democracies, a screwed-up government is given a shit, sometimes even judged and punished. In countries with dictatorships, frightened people come with flags and banners on the square and glorify the existing power, then in the kitchens they traditionally drink vodka and complain to each other. Those who try to open their mouths are called fagots and are publicly ridiculed; if they continue to be beaten out, there are many legal ways to calm a patient by closing him for a long time under the article.

" I do not know what he showed you there if you are not able to draw objective conclusions from the historical process. What conclusions have you come to, dear colleague, from the point of view of the scientific Marxist-Leninist position? Personally, my conclusions are quite obvious - the USSR crap. And with the words: Well, I couldn’t, I couldn’t. Threw hundreds of millions of self-educated citizens in fact into the external waters of the world capitalist ocean. Without any boats and lifebuoys. What is your conclusion? Well, you see, human nature does not at all remain unchanged, it can be completely changed, so why not use such developments to improve a person and society? And for some reason, such technologies are used, now, only to make herds of whole nations from whole nations. The USSR tried, why pretend to be a fool? The USSR tried to discern and nurture in man those lofty ideals that, in fact, should, in theory, distinguish man from animal. But the animal essence of people quickly adapted, and perverted everything. Because you cannot create an order that really subjugates the aspirations and instincts of people. You just can’t calculate everything, all the turns, all the possibilities. In this regard, capitalism is much more honest than communism, because at least it does not teach utopian ideals, and honestly gives everyone the opportunity to become a man. Another thing is that people, for the most part, do not use these opportunities. But this is the problem of people. Communism, on the other hand, tried to drive everyone along the line under one comb just to stupidly drive it into this framework. And what is the result? Since the collapse of the USSR, communism has been the haven of all romantics and idealists who do not want to look life in the face. It is even sadder because these are often the best people who could serve society. So what? Man is NOT ONLY an animal. Of course it is. Only human society will never be able to build such an ideology that will be a scientific and factory way to cultivate high ideals. Here's a scientific and factory way to educate animal ideals, please. We are now observing this everywhere. Everyone, with contented grunts, consumes, and does not look back. I conclude - it means they deserve it. People deserve to be animals, grunt and consume, why should they be distracted from this and dragged by force into some bright future if they do not need it? At the same time, everyone is free to set aside the trough and develop the spark of God in himself. Everyone has this opportunity. What kind of labor fraternity is this? I am in a completely scientific Marxist-Leninist position. It’s just that this picture illustrates this question well and this crazy position about human nature as greedy and selfish. Honestly, the scientific in your position is exactly the same as in mine. We are two demagogues who met on the fields of past battles. You rummage in the rotten dust of past years, examine the ashes, and look for answers there. I also rummaged until I realized how stupidly I spend time.

" that well, bullshit is all about gentlemanhood. I at one time these marital games so fucked up so much that I generally stopped sweating and began to behave as usual. without all these tweaks and the image of a nice guy. without a twinge of conscience in front of the girls, he smoked, hunkered, swore like a shoemaker, told amazing stories about how once he fucked up fucked someone woke up with a bleached chan retelling pasta about shit, etc. that is, he acted like a redneck, as usual I behave when there is no one around. and then the girls began to reach out. after that, I concluded for myself that girls do not perceive what you tell them, what you do, etc. they only perceive how you say and do all this. when I started to behave as usual, I did it, fucking, confidently, narcissistic, brazenly and like a male. maybe it woke up some instincts in the girls and they thought something in the style of well, that’s nothing redneck, but what a sure one, VAC is simple! or I dick knows, but this behavior has allowed me to enjoy certain popularity among girls. in general, if you delve into this whole topic, the image of relationships, love, behavior in all these marriage games, all this is imposed on us from birth by mass media, through books, films, beautiful love stories, etc. behave like a gentleman, wait for the one that will stir your soul and from which your heart will beat faster, and butterflies will fly in your stomach, put your whole life in the happiness of the second half, be a mountain, a getter, a fucking terrorist and all this other romantic, snotty bitch. and all this is fundamentally wrong. real love and relationships have nothing to do with the fact that we are driven into our heads from birth. all these high feelings are the usual desire to fuck. you see a person - you get a dose of the hormone - you get high. you don’t see a person - there is no dose of a hormone - withdrawal appears - you are looking for ways to see a person. here's a description of love. after some time, these feelings fade away one way or another, and if you besides these feelings didn’t have a fuck, then a divorce and a maiden name. true love is when you have thousands of reasons to be together, besides the fact that you have a strong desire to fuck. even when the desire to fuck has already passed, you still enjoy being together. the same imposition of light and romantic love, in my memory, caused quite a few problems for my friends girls. they sat idly and waited for the prince on a white horse for YEARS, referring to cool phrases if yours, then you will not miss, the promised three years are waiting for and other fucking. I myself tried to get to some as a candidate for guys, courted, called for a walk, tried to spend more time with them, but it all came down to one crap. namely, there’s a guy, he’s very popular, he’s not at all my level, he has whole armies of girls who want to jump on his little doll, and now she’s all so beautiful, I’ll sit quietly on the pope, I won’t fucking, he will notice me In the meantime, I will sweep away a bunch of normal options for relationships! oh poor I’m unhappy, I can’t find a guy for myself, 25 years old, but I go to girls all! . but why? but because from childhood they drove in that boys should take care of them, boys should roll up, and you, all so beautiful, should sit and wait for a ride to you and only weed out normal guys waiting for him - PRINT ON A WHITE HORSE !! 1 exactly so love and work, fuck !! 11! couple skidded me and baked fucked. all this gentlemanly bullshit. the image of modern love is still a game. I hope in a couple of dozen generations, all this romanticism and marriage games will become archaism and people will just fall in love and be together, without all this social and love slag. ",0

" And how do you feel about the Gesell experiment and the idea of ​​abandoning the cumulative function of money in general? Googled, read diagonally. This also implies regulation. Well, fuck do you need it? I am not against money with high volatility, but giving power over this money is a very bad idea. In my opinion, we must go towards greater transparency of public structures and control by private individuals. This is undoubtedly a step in the right direction. For me, if I myself do not produce fakes, then it turns out double naebalovo: both the state and the counterfeiter. This is so. On the other hand, money from the state does not get to you in any way, so for society as a whole it’s better to be fucked up by the participants of the society. And what will we invest if we have money - a limited resource? We will collect for a long time and to the detriment of something else. Well, excuse me, there are still taxes legal robbery. And so on all fronts. So are non-self-valuable money, too. So everything is market-oriented. Well, yes. Any money in one way or another obeys the laws of supply and demand. But decentralization is better then. You can, of course. There are workarounds like bitcoin mixers. Of course, this is already crutches, since the cue ball itself as a currency is not very perfect, to say the least. A crypt has appeared much more conveniently, and over time, successful options will gain capitalization and demand. As said above, the cue ball is more suitable for storing assets, and not for transactions. economic coercion has not disappeared. I would call it ECONOMIC MOTIVATION. To get rid of it means to get rid of the market and money in general; it is already closer to communism. Social Darwinism, and now flourishes, in fact. It’s just that in the countries of the first world it is hidden behind a high standard of living and developed social services. by the state I think it depends on how you look. So personal relationships are also subject to the market, respectively, non-competitive ones die off. I think this is normal, but this does not mean that everyone believes the same way and will not throw money to charity. Will be. And by the way, where do the ideas come from, in your opinion? Out of my head? I did not quite understand the question. Those. speculators is that good? Yes, speculators are good. I will show an example on a cue ball. The price is low. What will a speculator do? Buy cue ball. There are fewer free cues, their price is growing. This is beneficial to everyone who sells cue ball. Then, say, the price has risen dramatically. What will a speculator do? He will sell the cue ball. As there are more free cues, their price will decrease, which is beneficial to those who buy them. But, anyway, it evens out the course and makes jumps more rare. Bad speculators who buy expensive and sell cheap do exactly the opposite. But the markets solve them at a loss, so for a long time they cannot do this. ",1

" At one of the symposia, four linguists met: English, German, Italian, and Russian. It's about languages. They started to argue, and whose language is more beautiful, better, richer, and to which language does the future belong? The Englishman said: England is a country of great conquerors, sailors and travelers who spread the glory of her language to all corners of the whole world. English is the language of Shakespeare, Dickens, Byron, undoubtedly the best language in the world. Nothing of the kind, said the German, Our language is the language of science and physics, medicine and technology. The language of Kant and Hegel, the language in which the best work of world poetry is written by Faust Goethe. You are both wrong, the Italian entered into a dispute, Think, the whole world, all of humanity loves music, songs, romances, operas! What language do the best love romances and brilliant operas sound in? In the language of sunny Italy! The Russian was silent for a long time, listened modestly, and finally said: Of course, I could also, like each of you, say that the Russian language is the language of Pushkin, Tolstoy, Turgenev, Chekhov surpasses all the languages ​​of the world. But I will not go your way. Tell me, could you make a short story in your languages ​​with the eyeballs, with the consistent development of the plot, so that all the words of the story begin with the same letter? This very puzzled the interlocutors and all three said: No, in our languages ​​this is impossible. Then the Russian replies: But in our language it is quite possible, and now I will prove it to you. Name any letter. The German replied: Anyway. The letter P, for example. Great, here's a story for you on this letter, answered the Russian. Pyotr Petrovich Petukhov, lieutenant of the fifty-fifth Podolsky infantry regiment, received a letter in the mail full of good wishes. Come, wrote the charming Polina Pavlovna Perepelkina, we’ll talk, dream, dance, take a walk, visit a half-forgotten, half-grown pond, go fishing. Come, Pyotr Petrovich, to visit us as soon as possible. Petukhov liked the offer. Estimated: I’ll come. He grabbed a half-eared field coat and thought: it would be useful. The train arrived in the afternoon. Piotr Petrovich was received by the most respected Pope Pauline Pavlovna, Pavel Panteleimonovich. Please, Pyotr Petrovich, sit back comfortably, said Dad. A bald-headed nephew came up and introduced himself: Porfiry Platonovich Polikarpov. We ask, we ask. A lovely Polina appeared. Full shoulders covered a transparent Persian shawl. We talked, joked, invited to dine. They served dumplings, pilaf, pickles, liver, pate, pies, cake, half a liter of orange. Have a lunch. Pyotr Petrovich felt a pleasant satiety. After eating, after a hearty snack, Polina Pavlovna invited Pyotr Petrovich to take a walk in the park. In front of the park lay a half-forgotten half-grown pond. Ride under the sails. After swimming in the pond, we went for a walk in the park. We’ll sit down, Polina Pavlovna suggested. Sit down. Polina Pavlovna moved closer. We sat and were silent. The first kiss sounded. Pyotr Petrovich got tired, offered to lie down, spread a half-erased field raincoat, thought: he came in handy. Lie down, tumble, fall in love. Pyotr Petrovich, prankster, scoundrel, Polina Pavlovna habitually spoke. Marry, marry! whispered a bald nephew. Marry, marry, paddock approached the dad. Pyotr Petrovich turned pale, staggered, then ran away. After running, I thought: Polina Petrovna is a wonderful party, to take full steam. Before Peter Petrovich, a prospect flashed to get a wonderful estate. Hastened to send an offer. Polina Pavlovna accepted the offer, later married. Friends came to congratulate, brought gifts. Passing the package, they said: Lovely couple. The linguistic interlocutors, upon hearing the story, were forced to admit that Russian is the best and richest language in the world. ",0

" Well here it is. Pay attention to the wording: please provide us with the information necessary for decoding messages for the period. Not messages. A key information. That is, already on this phrase I get the impression that our valiant FSB officers are divorced from reality. Over the past half century, so many cryptographic algorithms and cryptographic schemes have been invented that give the server operator the legal ability to make paws (a one-time key for each message, does not persist, is synchronized in a tricky way through a shared secret). So I don’t argue that it’s all done clumsily and then some kind of circus begins. Well, in maxim - you can introduce a law that you need to eat shit, and then the question arises of the legitimacy of the law. I understand that it sounds wild, but the supremacy of international law and the same human rights formally is postulated in the same Constitution. Well here it is. Nevertheless, there is a law that allows law enforcement officers to read the correspondence of individuals who are suspected of something, and not stupidly, because it’s buit as I said, I’m in charge here, I want to - I’ll make shit eat me. And just recently, the UN adopted a resolution that the same crypto protection is an inalienable human right. So here is a complex legal incident mixed with moral standards. About human rights in general, it’s better not to talk to me. I do not know how to relate to the ECHR. On the one hand, yes, all people have the right to be treated as people. On the other hand, when I read the next verdict, where, for example, the ECHR decided to pay compensation to a couple of militants, because they, poor ones, were beaten during interrogations. And before that, the militants shot the police post (then) and killed several civilians, including the woman was beaten to death with butts. And you can understand the police post there, you can understand the man who, they believed, collaborated with the police, but the woman generally just got it, stupidly because they can. And they didn’t shoot him, but they beat him to death with their rifle butts, they were stupidly enjoying it. And I don’t feel sorry for something at all, such people were so fucked up. And in the end, I don’t even know how to relate to this, it seems that people are also, maybe you can even understand their motive, but they create such crap that it’s hard to call them people after that. Ok, I understand you, but, according to your citation, it also falls into private correspondence in some cases as a means of this very correspondence. Well, again, well, this telegram is being blocked not because there is some kind of information dangerous to the state regime that is being transmitted in huge quantities, but it’s stupid to annoy Durov. Although, in the end, they themselves made a laughing stock. By the way, he eventually eliminated the legal entity. face?

" And? He has freedom of movement, and drivers have a requirement of 1.5 to drive a vehicle so that it does not harm anyone. For an emergency, it’s not enough just to go on the road, actually. According to the SDA, when you see a pedestrian on the road, you should stupidly slow down to a stop. Traffic signs permitting 80 km h to go do not allow crushing people, and therefore, just in case, you must slow down until it stops completely. So, even if an emergency occurs, it is the fault of the driver who reacts incorrectly to the traffic situation while moving at high speed, although he should have thrown it off at the sight of a pedestrian ... It’s not the pedestrian's fault that you do not comply with traffic rules, you must manage the vehicle in such a way that you would not harm anyone - you cannot, surrender your rights, sell a car and do not drive it on the roads of Russia. Last year, 19,000 people were killed in traffic accidents, more than 200,000 were injured. He provoked an emergency with the consequences of his carcass. A pedestrian has the right to be anywhere, and on the road too. His mere presence is not a provocation because, according to the SDA, the driver must always expect him to appear on the road and in no case do harm. If you argue from your position, then when you saw you passing by the vehicle, you provoked me to robbery (for example, you took a suitcase from another passerby), and since you provoked me to do this, then you must judge and punish me for the theft. Here is such a causal-effect logic curve. Type you control the vehicle, you run over or some actions that led to an accident you, and someone else must judge. In the case you brought up, the vehicle driver is still to blame, because an accident arose from his actions, and the pedestrian did nothing, he simply walked by ... ",0

" You know, my friend lives with a man who was most likely cheating on her (some correspondence was torn apart, but he justified that it was only correspondence and didn’t get to a meeting), who for 5 years of living together does not know what the rent is and expenses for a child (from a friend’s previous marriage), only after 2 years of marriage he learned what it is to buy food at home, which considers his mother’s opinion more important than anyone in the world, who made an offer through a scandal, married through a scandal (secretly), said through his scandal and while waiting for a joint child in an apartment with unfinished repairs (tiled walls, concrete ceiling), he decided that he would buy himself a six and repair it and drift it. At the same time, for five years I’m already tired of listening to what a goat, a bastard, a bastard, he doesn’t need anything, he doesn’t want anything, and so on, scandals, intrigues, investigations. My opinion: if a man is a goat, why do you live with him. Either admit that she is a fool herself and stop whining, or go away and be with a normal man. At the same time, her opinion is: this is lyubof, I do not understand anything and she will teach me how to marry a man and how to live a family life in general. The second girlfriend pays loans for her ex-husband so far. My only conclusion: women are often fools. Fair. Here in life, smart and professionals in their field, and they seem to look at life sensibly, and in relationships - fools. Because they hammered into your head that if it’s lyubof, then that's it - you need to bear this cross and allow anything you want to address it. At the same time, the husband was the first - he behaved quite differently with the previous passion. Yes, and life is somewhat infantile, but not so much a goat. And there are brains. The ex-husband is the second, also a good person, but with his wife, who has not been home for weeks, she plows at three jobs and gets three times as much, because the profession and recognition at work is more important than anything else - he relaxed and hung his legs. It's just that everyone is responsible for his life. And I see a lot of examples of how women consider the norm in the family that which, from my point of view, is completely abnormal and unacceptable. And they sacredly believe in it. I do not condone men and do not blame women, but if you live with someone sucks, why do you live with this person. If you need something from a relationship, you are ready to do something, to seek compromises, and your partner would like to put everything on it - why do you need such a relationship. And I will answer why - because very often the girls are driven in, that if you are without a man - atatata, if you haven’t touched the child - atat, if you are alone, then you are unhappy. The result - a woman runs, clutches at someone and holds on, and thinks to herself - do not care that she is unhappy, but with a man, unlike these failed ones. Or he goes into work with his head, so as not to get involved in this epic with relationships, where everything slowly collapses, if you do not pay time and attention. The result in both cases is deplorable. And yes, both friends during the first marriage tried to teach me how to get married and live happily by example. Both are divorced and married a second time. But this is all a big digression, yes. But the general idea is this: if a woman loves not only her man, but herself and appreciates herself, she will not sit in a pool of shitty relations, she will not disappear at work either, and her man will not be crushed under the heel. Yes, a lot depends on a man, but not everything - yes, if a man also loves his woman, appreciates himself and her - everything will be fine with them. Plus, it depends on the woman more - in what environment the child will grow. Will he absorb the example of a father and who will be the father of this child in general. And that means - it depends more on a woman what the next generation will be. Men have a slightly different role in this play, but it depends on the woman whether a tyrant rag of hysterics and so on will multiply and bring up a victim. And this responsibility personally makes me a little depressed and forces me to make increased demands on myself, as a female representative. ",1

" As you know, Ukr ina (i.e. okr ini), stuck together drunk on a knee in the 2nd decade of the 20th century, has no history until the 20th century. All the lands that Ukraine now occupies are Russian, Romanian, Polish and Hungarian lands. We remind you that Ukraine is a purely leftist, anti-conservative, small-town-farm ideology, aimed, like other leftist ideas, to divide large nations and maintain the dictatorship of the internacists. Supporters of Bandera (leftists who advocated a classless society and the struggle against capitalism) and the dwarf cat-strangler Stepan Bandera, who, as you know, fought against racism, supported Idel-Ural and called the twin cities of Islamic freedom fighters from Azerbaijan, do not enjoy the sympathies of the right Europeans. And it is right. Attempts to declare a certain separate nation of some Ukrainians are manipulations designed to tear off part of their ethnic lands from the Russians and weaken Russia in the future. Only in this way, with a monstrous lie and total propaganda, the fake nation of Ukrainians, molded by Soviet puppeteers from the Russians of the South and Kiev region, Galicians, Poles, Soviet Romanians, Slavicized Hutsuls, Transcarpathian Hungarians, Jews, Tatars and multinational Soviet Noviopes (a la Babchenko) find life on Russian ethnic lands. Of course, there is no nation of Ukrainians, no matter how one neighboring failed state tries to get them out of the Russians by deceit, distorting history and outright falsification. The current experiment to create a certain Ukrainian nation can only be compared with the Soviet experiment to create a Soviet nation on the basis of the same myths, fakes, and outright nonsense. And the manic desire to demolish all the monuments to the geek Lenin (Blanca) should not be encouraging. To replace him, they erect the monuments of the same leftist degenerate-cat-dog Bandera, whose hands are to the elbow in Slavic (primarily Polish) blood. Instead of the soviet lie about the Great Revolution of October, exactly the same impudent lie about the Great Revolution came; abstract from the figure of a blogger and watch the video What we ended up with in the Soviet experiment, we all know. We are waiting for the logical outcome of the elven experiment (excuse me, Ukrainian).

As a musician (i.e. a person who has certain thinking and hearing, is able to compose, improvise, play complex rhythmically confused music and other things that really top performers can do) - Fredhystarist is a complete jerk, I can’t understand how you can go crazy with a dude who plays for 3-4 seconds the same turntables or quinte sequences (in lessons, in streams) or saws domestic govnometal like a little progressive Aria? I’m especially worried about the fact that five thousand students passed through the top guitar teacher Fred, but for some reason you can choose one or two tolerably playing dudes at his guitar competitions with grief in half. Are there really fifty people out of all these thousands of students who have learned to play and would like to participate in the Fred competitions? Karoch, my opinion, Fred is a forum hitch, far from the music world, who trained a little, learned a couple of guitar chips and immediately rushed to squeeze money from schoolchildren for lessons. Partly said (or rather said) the right things, and there was a very successful format for video tutorials, but most of these things are understandable to any professional musician.

" Rumors that the Russian president has counterparts who appear instead of him at various public events have been circulating for a long time. As it turned out, the theory of the existence of Putin's clones is supported by one of the first leaders of the DPR, terrorist Igor Girkin. He spoke about this at a press conference in Russia, where he was asked a very peculiar question. The militant who escaped to the Russian Federation was offered to put an end to Putin’s proposal to be executed cannot be pardoned. The corresponding fragment of the press conference was shown on the Sobinews channel during an interview with Ukrainian journalist Roman Tsymbalyuk. And which one? They are now shown at least three. One hundred percent sure Putin will not be overthrown by a popular revolution Putin will not be overthrown by his own circle, said terrorist Girkin. Famous astropsychologist Valentina Wittrock spoke about Putin's doubles. She noted that the fact of Putin’s clones is obvious and explained that outwardly they differ not only from the original, but also from each other. Let’s say, on one of the doubles’ hands, Buryats by nationality have fingers as thick as sausages. Look at the location and shape of wrinkles, earlobes, which are different for all people, like fingerprints, the expert says. Recall, Putin's new double dumbfounded his hairy appearance. ",0

" Bloomberg learned about working out a scenario for leaving Putin in power According to Bloomberg interlocutors, one of them involves the unification of Russia with Belarus. Lukashenko previously opposed such an option, and the Russian ambassador said that Moscow hadn’t made such proposals. The presidential administration is considering various options that will allow Vladimir Putin to remain in power for as long as possible, three sources close to the Kremlin told Bloomberg. One of the scenarios involves the creation of a new state through unification with Belarus, Putin will lead the new country, which will allow him to circumvent constitutional restrictions on the number of presidential terms. Political analyst and former presidential administration official Andrei Kolyadin told the agency that the Kremlin was actively discussing a scenario similar to what is happening in Kazakhstan. Moscow will monitor how much Nursultan Nazarbayev, after retiring from the post of president of Kazakhstan, will be able to control the situation and how the influence will be distributed in the new configuration, said Alexander Baunov, editor-in-chief of the Carnegie Moscow Center website. It is impossible to repeat Nazarbayev’s strategy in Russia, political analyst Arkady Dubnov told the agency, because Russia's political system is more complex than Kazakhstan’s. RBC sent a request to the presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov. In December 2018, President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko at a press conference said that Moscow, under the pretext of deep integration, wants to include the country in Russia. And some say bluntly: we are ready for you to become part of the Russian Federation in six regions, he said. However, Russian Ambassador to Minsk Mikhail Babich said on March 1 that there were no such proposals and that Moscow favors the development of the Union State of Russia and Belarus. ",0

" Firstly, a prostitute can also. Can. And then there will be a finish from the pimp. Well or not. Because the same pimp will blackmail her. add an even more undesirable profession - the military The military is paid more. And the prestige of the profession is very high. And they have social guarantees, such as payments for title, length of service, apartments, early retirement. The prostitutes do not have all this. And it will not even be with legalization. Instead of early retirement, they will be thrown out in the cold with a bare ass and replaced with another one. Thirdly, the miner is not exposed to violence, but to the dangers and harmful working conditions of MUCH more prostitutes. The harmfulness of the mining profession is classified according to the TOC, as a result of passing through which the miner social guarantees are again accrued in the form of additional payments, holidays, a year and a half, etc. For prostitutes, even with legalization, no one will carry out such a classification. The prestige is not so high, but no one will blame the miner for the activity in which he is engaged. The policeman, again, has the risk of being subjected to more violence, as he interacts with crime in the same way as a prostitute. Not only with crime, but also with any inadequacy, who had a piece of paper with views of Vladivostok and who imagined that everything was allowed to him. Again, prostitutes will not have any of the social guarantees that the police have. And it will not appear even with legalization. In general, if you are trying to prove that prostitution is the most dangerous profession in the world, then this is somehow ridiculous. I am trying to prove that prostitution is the sale of people. Where the very unprotected and least paid are the very people who are selling. And the main evil is the buyers. And the legalization of this will not change. ",0

" Apparently, she didn’t ascribe it (at least for pensions - they introduced pensions for collective farmers much later), but in tsarist Russia birth and death registration was assigned to the church and this metric was conducted only for Orthodox Christians. In combination with mass illiteracy, this made massive mistakes in determining the age when passports were issued to former Gentiles in Soviet times. As far as I understood from the educational structure of the Kazan province, before the revolution it was impossible to enter and finish the three-year period without knowing the Russian language. For those who know only their own language, Tatars and Chuvashs (both baptized and Muslim), one-year periods were provided. But your husband’s grandmother could well have finished the three-year plan already in Soviet times as part of the educational program. I think that when the issuance of passports to all rural residents began in the late 1920s, a misunderstanding occurred - the grandmother herself did not know her exact age, and the employee who prepared the documents understood her words about her late marriage, as it was understood in the city. In the village, 18 years old was already considered to be a late date for girls to marry, in Russian, at least. Grandmother said that her birth certificate was issued much later, and the date of birth indicated on him on August 1 is most likely incorrect - her mother, my great-grandmother, said that she did not remember the exact date and simply named August.

No, he just says that typing with one finger is normal, that single-finger printing is a variant of the norm, in ancient Greece typing with one finger was courageous, etc. As for the last paragraph - again, these are stereotypes. A woman who knows how to fight - a lesbian? Because fighting is a man’s task? A man who likes to shop and cook - fag? A man caring for himself? Tinting lips and wearing a thong - fag? Who decided that cosmetics and thongs were for women? Formally, this is just clothes. And if a man loves anal sex with his girlfriend? Why would he become a fag from this or, moreover, a woman in a male body? My thought is in one paragraph. There is no norm, and no deviations. There are no internal borders. There are sexual preferences and desires. And the differences between a clever approach and a forehead approach are not to set strict preferences in these preferences, transferring people from group to group. Refuse to classify people.

The ladies know about my status, they have broken my capabilities, but nevertheless, they encroach on the sacred in local morality - on the family. 1. Question - for what purpose? In reality, goals are different, not always the result: to create a cell with just this representative .. If you are interested in how a person with your inner world and other things will immediately refuse. Otherwise, drag, have to get out. If you decide something, or break up a family - well .. I can play, go to a meeting. To sleep? - easy, but there will be no continuation. Naturally, for taking advantage of what was offered, it requires payment. We live in the age of the market. If you try to twist - a sharp break in any relationship. I’m before my young wife - in any case, I will be justified, and there is no such evidence base. But cunning can be bad. The fact that a girl 20 years younger than me may be interested in my body, or, say, sex skills, I do not believe. And even if this is so - just 1 point, God forbid I get attached to such a pervert. One is already. But, if I suddenly become attached, I will be part of what I have to give. You have to pay for everything. Although I am for one-time shares, and not for long-term obligations. Now about the resources. In my first marriage I was a monk. No no. Morality did not, although loot and opportunities were already then. When I met a real wife - everything was generally gorgeous, so as not to slow down on her. But attached to her. And dog, I didn’t sew in the ass. It's just that, as you just noticed, you attract attention. Well, once or twice a year someone decides. We have to make a decision. In short - I'm crying, which means I also order music in a relationship. But one of my assistants for 19 years - an athlete, a handsome man, his tongue suspended, a thunderstorm of girls - he immediately behaved, as I am now. Well, he had resources right away. Natural. Sorry for the confusion, maybe I didn’t answer clearly. But I'm already caught in a honey trap. The rest of the women are just bodies. With problems, but without a soul. For me. ",1

" Well, Lada yes, a mistake. It is necessary to divide 90,000 rubles, then 12.5 cars are obtained. Or about the same number of good foreign cars, if divided at today's prices. But we must also bear in mind that in Soviet times, cash and non-cash were completely different money. No one could have non-cash, not even Churbanov. Therefore, he had cash, which, if I remember correctly, on the black market were converted to cashless as 1:10. That is, for 1 cash ruble you could get the same as for 10 non-cash. So, in non-cash rubles, Churbanov would have had 900,000 rubles. At the same time, cars in cash and non-cash were worth the same price (yes, strange, but this is the economy of the USSR). So if Churbanov had a cashless account to which he would receive bribes, he would be able to buy 10 times more cars. And vice versa - to transfer a large amount of non-cash into cash without being noticed was almost impossible. Therefore, cash was valued highly. Today there is no difference between cash and cashless. Therefore, bribes can be of any size. But about dollars and rubles can be counted until 1985 only at the official rate. Because there was no other. The black market was under a deep ban, they were specifically planting currency, which is why the black market cannot be taken into account. The volumes on it were scanty, completely tiny, single operations per year, which did not affect anything, and accordingly the price of the currency on it was not justified by anything. ",0

" And the development of China without noticeable crises - this is a sign of developing socialism - planning. And this is a sign of a developed state. capitalism. Where the ruling bureaucracy simply stops all crises on time by an injection of resources. At some point in China, overproduction crises began to manifest, resources were allocated quickly on the road network (of all kinds, especially high-speed) and now, in China, one of the most developed infrastructures, only spurred the market. But such infrastructure could pay off only in China. But state capitalism does not contradict socialism. This is an element. Planning was a sign of socialism in Soviet times, although the States themselves used planning to the full, especially in the space program. In the United States, planning was partially used to stop the effects of capitalism (as well as elements of socialism, by the way). But socialism, planning is used in large quantities, China uses it as a normal communist country - wherever it can. The Chinese then also need to hurry. The United States has clearly decided to deal with China, and Trump’s second term will probably be the time to begin active actions. And where in a hurry.

This is a completely logical reaction to the fact that they were about to be dispossessed. I’m looking at all the kings (!) of the USSR and consider them to be fuckers, including their fucking greed, cruelty and thirst for power. And here you are late. The USSR made Russia a superstate with a strong education, a powerful economy, enormous military power and a bunch of innovative technologies. You can talk about morality and ethics as much as you like, but statistics cannot be denied. You can not argue with her. What we have? Life expectancy - increased by 2 times. Education - from 10 to 90 of the population. Population growth - 40kk. The standard of living is growing. Electrification is the whole state. You can not argue with numbers. Look at the pictures. Is this really the result of the work of tyrants and the king? Is this the result of the work of murderers and Russophobia? Or what, statistics were replaced and in RI people were not hungry, cold, uneducated and without light? Maybe they invented some technologies in RI, eh? Does someone oppress you? The capitalists. Everything at once. Everything is simple. litter, but you're just dumb. all current communists are just fucking ostriches, if I put my head in the sand and don’t see the facts, it means that they are gone What facts. Here I have statistical facts in the pictures. You tell me about hunger and repression, and I tell you that a person’s life span has increased from 30 years to 70, and the population has grown from 170kk to 214kk. Where are the repressions? Where is the hunger? Why do they contradict statistics? there were no shots. But not much on the case. And what? You can’t shoot criminals? Why? did not like the commies - you are a subhuman, shoot. I do not want to upset you, but communism is the dictatorship of the proletariat. That is, the decision to shoot is made not by one person, but by the whole state, it is simply signed by the person responsible. And if the whole state doesn’t like you - well, it’s my fault, I’m probably doing crap. I wouldn’t do crap, and if necessary, I would change for the public good. Therefore, they would not have shot me, I’m not a criminal, like those who were shot in the USSR. the fact that uncles on the Internet with pseudo-facts said that the communists were saints. Nobody says that they were saints. Moreover - on all the channels that I advised, they criticized the USSR in many respects. The problem is that criticism of the USSR from outside, that is, not from the camp of the left forces, always comes down to memes of the Katyn and Holodomor level, which are pure lies and slander on the entire left corps. read about the Molotov-Ribentrop Pact It was, yes. The whole point was that in the eyes of the communist there is no difference between the bourgeois Nazi and the bourgeois imperialist. Therefore, the expectations of the Communists were that all the dirt re-breed itself and we will restore their state under the communist flag. Guo Khitlur was fucked up and decided to fight the whole world. the capture of Poland There is no such thing as a capture in the world of communism. Communism implies an international and a world state. You can’t seize someone else’s territory because all territories belong to communism. katyn This is a meme and fake. The Poles huirili their own in pursuit of power. mass migration of entire nations within the country. What is bad in the distribution of productive forces? This is a trivial optimization. gulag What is bad in prisons for criminals in the distance? for you and your idols, there is only one problem in the world today. This is probably why every year there are more and more Communists, as well as the real opposition that is fighting for the rights of people in Russia are the Communists, right? it is ridiculous that each of you adherents of communism fidgets for the capitalist kukan, condemning what fucking ideas I have for this kukan, if only he were red. Computers are now a capitalist idea, lol? Shchta? Did you even go there chtoli? Once again - communism is not to sit in a dark damp basement and eat a beef anus, communism is progress and justice. The first computers were invented in the USSR. The USSR made a huge contribution to the development of computer technology and invented brilliant ternary logic. The USSR made cankulators and televisions, made radios and telephones. Are you really fucking there? The communist’s speech was about playing toys, but it’s time to use computers for work, no more. you do not see point blank; blasphemy to explain to you I do not see. Throw off the shabmki. ",1
" On March 18, Russian media drew attention to photographs taken by the head of the Investigative Committee, Alexander Bastrykin, during a personal reception of citizens on March 13. During the meeting, Bastrykin at some point looks through a magnifying glass at the laptop screen, discussing the case of Dmitry Zekov. Bastrykin’s photos with a magnifying glass began to be discussed in social networks and composed memes. After that, the press service of the UK issued an official explanation, which raises even more questions. Where and why strange shadows and traces appear on the video is difficult to answer. The quality of the recording does not allow us to make definitive conclusions. A dynamic image of a moving person in the approximation after processing may look like a moving spot. In some cases, the use of image processing software, including digital zoom, does not produce the same effect as optical zoom using, for example, a magnifier. Enlarged pixels can significantly distort the perception of information, according to a response to a News.ru request. This message was not published on the SK website, but the official Twitter agency retweeted the News.ru post. The chairman of the IC of Russia at the receptions of citizens always attentively refers to details that may be of fundamental importance for establishing the truth in a criminal case, the department added. Why Bastrykin magnifier? The report of the investigative committee shows that when working with documents, Alexander Bastrykin puts on reading glasses. To view the video, he takes off his glasses and takes a magnifying glass. It is advised to use a magnifier instead of glasses in order to consider small inscriptions or, for example, details of prefabricated models. Most likely, Bastrykin is simply more comfortable looking at the details on the screen through a magnifying glass than wearing glasses. ",1

He disguises himself with tradition and local customs, and his apologists say that force is ridiculous and without it it is already impossible. No one calls him funny, no one says that you cannot do without him. Everyone at the end was startled by a discussion of certain topics, and Ann was having so much fun. The last scrolls came out at 11m, and no one played tales and legends, and some especially gifted are considered Nikon at all. And homophors is just talking in a thread about everything without a clear theme. However, if it is forced without measure for 3 consecutive years and seeps into other threads, annoying anonov, then this should be stopped. seeps into other threads Here are the baths of those who seep without measure Where were you a year and a half ago, when 35 thread questions hung on the board? This was without measure, but now there are almost no grintext frags. Now you have to insert homophors in regular posts, but even rub them: And this is the answer to the question about the homophorser, which was rubbed 1257469 without a damn thing. He’s not climbing here, this is his board. Homofors is an integral part of the sword that has been around for two and a half years. But how homohaiter like you crawl here is a question. The systematic observance of the rules of the section, the lack of selective attitude or favoritism in relation to one or another force is Aha, so I was banned for homophors yesterday, and not for Dunmer whores a week ago. guarantee of stable posting on an honest board. As if homophors interferes with communication. Again, 35 threads full of grintext and schizo sheets. And no one bothered anyone. The reason they used to turn a blind eye to him was local humoresque. One of the previous urinals called this a tradition. I don’t remember a single case when they banned for the posts above, always for the grintext. But the grintext stopped - bans began for any mention of homophores. Therefore, announcements that persist in homophors can and will be banned for an average period of a week or two. Particularly stubborn can fall under permach. That's all. That's only with a dick whether urine interferes with the communication of announcements. None of the recent posts with homophors received a continuation in the form of a single-line srach, were they rubbed with a dick? Why is this post bad? There is no 100 true version of the freezing of Atmora, and each has a headcanon, as bequeathed to Mishan. Does my headcanon make urine unpleasant? When the Nords were sitting under the boot of the great Aldmer of the great Altmore, everything was fine. The Cyrodiil has a jungle, Altmore has a warm climate, and the whole Skyrim was covered with forests. The thing is that the Aldmeri, performing rituals glorifying their gods, created a lot of heat with their hot bodies, male Aldmeri worked tirelessly to maintain a favorable climate, but the Nords were cold and immoral. They preferred women to men, and such a vicious, dirty love can not be compared with the heat of ardent Aldmeri men, intertwining forming so much heat that enough for the whole continent. When the power of the Nords and the Deceiver came, all the Aldmerians were killed, and the great traditions of male love were banned, and the once ever-green Altmore began to turn into the icy wasteland of Atmora. As a result, the Nords themselves were forced to flee to Skyrim, where they slaughtered Falmers, which is why half of Skyrim is now unsuitable for life because of the cold. The Ayleids suffered the same fate, and instead of the humid jungle in Cyrodiil, there are now simple forests. Previously, the grintext srach was deployed, with a detailed description of who rushes to whom and to what extent. And it didn’t ban. Maybe urine just liked these homoerotic stories, and he gets angry with us because they ceased to be original, and then they were completely abandoned. You tell us, I think it can be fixed. ",1

" A resident of Kiev, as a result of careless handling of firearms, shot his own mother in the stomach. A few days later, the woman died in the hospital. The defendant in this case faces up to 5 years in prison. This was reported by the press service of the National Police of Kiev on Tuesday, March 19. It is noted that the duty unit of the Desnyansk police department received a call about a gunshot wound on Vladimir Mayakovsky Avenue. The crews of the patrolmen and the investigative-operational group of the police department immediately arrived at the call. According to the head of the Desnyansk police department, Alexander Kosovsky, law enforcement officers found out on the spot that a 36-year-old man accidentally shot a revolver under Flaubert's cartridge and wounded his mother in the stomach. The Kievite drank for a long time, because of this, conflicts arose between him and his mother. On that day, the quarrel ended with the hospitalization of the 68-year-old victim in the hospital. A week later, from a medical institution, we received a message about the death of a woman. In the process of obtaining additional materials, the investigators retrained the criminal proceedings from negligent grievous bodily harm to murder through negligence, the report said. An investigator of the investigative department of the Desnyansk police department announced a man suspected of committing a crime under Art. 119 (Assassination by Negligence) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. The sanction of the article provides for up to five years in prison. ",1

" US President Donald Trump said that he was seriously considering the possibility of Brazil’s membership in NATO. He spoke about this at a joint press conference with his Brazilian counterpart Jair Bolsonar, reports Reuters. Washington intends to declare Brazil the main strategic ally among non-NATO countries, and admits the possibility of Brazil's membership in the alliance. This will greatly enhance security and cooperation between our countries, the American leader explained. In addition, Trump supports Bolsonar’s desire to join the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. According to the American leader, relations between countries have never been so close. Earlier, Bolsonaro called for clearing Brazil of dirty leftist views. It was noted that the trip of the Brazilian leader to Washington should demonstrate the commitment of the South American country of the United States, which is a deviation from the country's traditional diplomatic line. Bolsonaru became president of Brazil on October 28, 2018. He noted that he plans to change the direction of the country's movement and move closer to developed economies, rather than regional allies.

" Most often, aggression and aggressiveness is manifested in youth entertaining resources and forums with a political theme, experts found out. Most often, young people and girls under the age of 19 are engaged in cyberbullying. The Analytical Center Brand Analytics conducted a study of cyberbullying in Russian social media to determine what features haters have on the Russian-speaking Internet. The results of the study are at the disposal of RBC. Brand Analytics used two types of materials from open Russian-language Internet sources: firstly, messages from social media for October 2018, their total number exceeded 6.8 million; secondly, the frequency distribution of words for December of the same year was analyzed. The company notes that they considered cyberbullying as one of the manifestations of aggression (along with racism, harassment, sexism, etc.), that is, directed influence on the object in order to cause damage to it. On the Internet, such an impact can be a reduction with the help of one to one hundred status of the subject or object of the message. Messages were also analyzed for the content of aggressiveness, that is, a person’s linguistic reaction to the negative impact of the external environment or their own internal dissatisfaction. Of the nearly 7 million messages analyzed, about 5 carried aggressiveness. Experts came to the conclusion that most often aggression and aggression are found on entertainment domains of the youth age category (2ch.hk, yaplakal.com, pikabu.ru are examples), e-sports resources (prodota.ru, dota2.ru, etc.) , as well as on forums where political topics are discussed (echo.msk.ru, politforums.net, etc.). At the same time, the level of aggression was noticeably higher than the level of aggressiveness in the latter. In other words, when discussing politics, people quite often turn to personalities, explained in Brand Analytics. Further on the list with a slight lag are women’s sites and forums for motorists. More often than not (more than 86 messages), users whose messages contained aggression did not turn them against the person, but reacted in such a way to events. Messages with aggression aimed at a specific person or group of people, 13.9. Least of all, users of social networks showed aggression against an inanimate object (about 2.1). As analysts expected, the relative aggressiveness of the male part of users was higher than that of the female, and peaks of aggressive behavior in both male and female users were recorded in the age groups of 14–19 years and 25–35 years. The maximum peak is 14 years, experts attributed this to the fact that most social networks allow user registration only when this age is reached. For users older than 35 years, the level of aggressiveness is gradually reduced, however, in women again rises at the age of 55 65 years. Experts also found that most often users were aggressive with the help of adverbs and interjections (according to the intensity of use about 70 from all parts of speech), less often with the help of verbs and adjectives.

I encourage his statements about world-class stars ... but he does not want to disclose this topic more fully, because if he specifically reveals it, then there will be no srach, and he is very important for him and his channel as a whole, as I understand it.

" It has long been clear that the subject who went to Resonance is prone to sterility, verbal swelling (I.P. Pavlov). The resonator uses complex expressions, foreign words, neologisms to explain simple things 1. Speech is replete with complex logical constructions, elaborate abstract concepts, terms that are often used without understanding their true meaning. If the patient with thoroughness seeks to fully answer the doctor’s question, then for patients with resonance it does not matter if their interlocutor understood or not. They are interested in the process of thinking, and not the final thought. Thinking becomes amorphous, devoid of a clear content. Discussing simple everyday issues, patients find it difficult to accurately formulate the subject of the conversation, express themselves floridly, and consider problems from the point of view of the most abstract sciences (philosophy, ethics, cosmology).

" In Kiev, at the Men Bulok Rock station, at 19, if I had to do it the first time, go to the ass rock in step 30. I went to the train station in v-Pasazhirsky to the toilet - write a letter to the station nah. Since, as it were, there was nothing wrong with it, then I didn’t recognize it. The very first one is naturally not suitable. And vidivlivshis on write. Jerking off the holy member of the standing in the office. Dear Buv at the bottom of the day, having swayed at N, having hit me with his head, asking for five of them. And so, as it were, no one at that moment was bland, but it was already forever, but not at all — all the seam behind him. At me even toddler appeared molofey - I lowering it as well. So, as before, trocha weren’t blunders before, but when I masturbated, I would take a lot of time — if it just made me feel better — I didn’t see anything. And until the last time, men dubbed a dick every once a month, I lowered them into my mouth and knew a lot. Mi came to the station wake up to the bush. Having thrashed me off, becoming the first member, becoming a masturbate. And at that hour, navigating as if someone else's hand was just a mere jerk off wanking me - all at once was a blow. took away. If you want to masturbate with a stranger’s hand in childhood, all the same: in the twentieth day the bulldozer. Well, yummy, you’ll be guessing that before him there’s a freshman who didn’t want to give me a hand: So, in my head, and then asked me to turn around: I’ve powered up, I really don’t want to go! and in saying treba so. I turned like a team of tall teams. In n, having lowered the men’s trousers, the cowards, standing up to a tree, stood by one of the men, the trochs bent to me. And he got up behind him. By the sounds, I zrozum in, but I want to keep my motny d hundred holy member. In n, he was pretending to moose with his cock, in which I trembled, but in n took the member of my name again, becoming a jerk off. And with your own hand drive along the stitches from the inside. P d ymayuchsya in d kol n to pop - tse favored a buzz on d jerk off, I ml in, n tsezh in dvechuv, even after quietly becoming rubbed by his dick men pop. Then, ceasing to jerk off my man, I felt like I was blunting my penis, my daughter putting my penis in my hand, pushing me into the tree of the trocha, bending me down, the member in me shoved. I was standing bent over, resting my hands on a tree, n living, n dead - the first time in life a lad in me shoved his dick! I was afraid that everything would be like that, but would be with me, like that. Men spared, for no reason at all, for the first time, a new thin cock. This one had no problems with getting the fucking dick in my bonding ass. Oskki Luki Men did not bulo much more, but I couldn’t stand standing hard. Chekayuchi, as it were, gave:. In n thrusting his penis all in me. If only he was pushing him in, but the bulo rested on him. Ale is no more than the call of M. Treba tell me honestly, what a lot it was like when I got a hand, if the eggs of yo got to the butt, my daughter, if the whole penis is all right, I have it in my sight, if I saw it wisely shoved a member of you: Tsebulo mabut nav on with much less everything - in a fresh egg for a point. If the whole member is there. if in the middle of becoming a bati mene, I caught a spaghetti, more often than not, the eggs of yo pressed into the popumen, so that the node itself would go even farther on the ith pen, to the stop. However, it seemed that in many cases it was not gloomy - for more than an hour I was just standing with my hands around the tree and inserting a penis into me. Wanting a special buzz, I wasn’t in my heart again, but in my heart I just shook my dick by walking there. So in the middle of the month, produzhuyuchi at once all the time an hour with one hand to masturbate men - ntrimuyuchi in the bazhenya menu: - the axis for the fifth day was a lot. Naturally. Tse buv yogo rosrahunok. I finish the shvydka in the house with a stranger’s hand, lowering it into the cockpit with the third cock. Ale, however, has a decreasing sticky back on the quilts: More often, the quilting is on the point. the axis was much more embarrassed. hammered in - I guessed zrozum in scho in n having lowered in me. Having energized, - How little have you gotten with me? in saying so. having energized me - but just the last time I’ve tried? I didn’t cry a little in the way of saying so, the first time: by setting up a nourishment for yomu - did you really let me down? I didn’t let go of everything, thinking about it, I would just shove everything in me, but then it became uncomfortable: it was disastrous, - especially after that I myself started up, - I’ve got a foreign guide on me, as if I’d been a foreigner malofu. So much more on your own. Ale to the right, the Bula is scattered: clapping 19 rock in the hole! let sperm youmu point! Into a string, a spring, I’m reaping an ass with a new girl, stuffing my penis again and again! At the first moment, the bulo was enormous in this sticky, a little warm, it became stiff, and the sweat caught on like this: (and since I didn’t get ready for anything, then Withery was bad :) Tod was awesome, not for nothing vi bav, but scho did not bother, lowering me. So, as the sperm sprimmed itself, it seems to be frozen, more so on. Then I thought about it later, having imagined a malt, to bajazhnyam, so I could say it again: I’ve done it more quickly, and the sticky string on the quilts has been making an entire hour, it’s less than bleating in the ass.

" As you know, Ukr ina (i.e. okr ini), stuck together drunk on a knee in the 2nd decade of the 20th century, has no history until the 20th century. All the lands that Ukraine now occupies are Russian, Romanian, Polish and Hungarian lands. We remind you that Ukraine is a purely leftist, anti-conservative, small-town-farm ideology, aimed, like other leftist ideas, to divide large nations and maintain the dictatorship of the internacists. Supporters of Bandera (leftists who advocated a classless society and the struggle against capitalism) and the dwarf cat-strangler Stepan Bandera, who, as you know, fought against racism, supported Idel-Ural and called the twin cities of Islamic freedom fighters from Azerbaijan, do not enjoy the sympathies of the right Europeans. And it is right. Attempts to declare a certain separate nation of some Ukrainians are manipulations designed to tear off part of their ethnic lands from the Russians and weaken Russia in the future. Only in this way, with a monstrous lie and total propaganda, the fake nation of Ukrainians, molded by Soviet puppeteers from the Russians of the South and Kiev region, Galicians, Poles, Soviet Romanians, Slavicized Hutsuls, Transcarpathian Hungarians, Jews, Tatars and multinational Soviet Noviopes (a la Babchenko) find life on Russian ethnic lands. Of course, there is no nation of Ukrainians, no matter how one neighboring failed state tries to get them out of the Russians by deceit, distorting history and outright falsification. The current experiment to create a certain Ukrainian nation can only be compared with the Soviet experiment to create a Soviet nation on the basis of the same myths, fakes, and outright nonsense. And the manic desire to demolish all the monuments to the geek Lenin (Blanca) should not be encouraging. To replace him, they erect the monuments of the same leftist degenerate-cat-dog Bandera, whose hands are to the elbow in Slavic (primarily Polish) blood. Instead of the soviet lie about the Great Revolution of October, exactly the same impudent lie about the Great Revolution came; abstract from the figure of a blogger and watch the video What we ended up with in the Soviet experiment, we all know. We are waiting for the logical outcome of the elven experiment (excuse me, Ukrainian). Of course, zombie people will cling to the last for their myths about the hotel people and other Muscovites, but all this obsession will disappear sooner or later, as Scoop with his powerful ideology, myths and fakes disappeared.

" Today in the Volgograd Regional Court a consideration of the appeal of the lawyer of the 34-year-old minibus took place. A man is suspected of a serious crime of raping a 13-year-old schoolgirl. In early February, immediately after the arrest, the district court detained the suspect. However, it turned out that the rapist, a native of Azerbaijan, does not speak Russian well, and he needed to provide an interpreter. Today, precisely this argument has become the main argument of the defense during the consideration of the appeal. Naturally, the judge could not violate the law and dismiss the lawyer's complaint, and since the absence of an interpreter is a serious procedural violation, the arrest was canceled. This information was confirmed to the correspondent of the newspaper Volgograd.ru by the press service of the Volgograd Regional Court. A real legal incident arose, since it takes time for a new petition by the investigation for the arrest, and it will be considered only at the next meeting. Thus, the suspect in a felony, who is also a visitor, was released. According to unofficial information, he has already been released from custody. It is hoped that law enforcement officers will not allow the rapist of a 13-year-old schoolgirl to escape from the Settlement and not answer for her vile crime. ",0

" Since the beginning of the year, over 40 thousand Russians have declared themselves self-employed, but soon faced with blocking their accounts by banks, which prohibit individuals from using personal accounts to conduct business. About this writes the portal Banki.Ru. According to tax experts, credit organizations do not always know how to qualify the activities of self-employed. They receive income on their personal cards, although the use of an individual’s account for entrepreneurial activity is usually expressly prohibited in the service contract. As a result, self-employed Russians were faced with blocking accounts. A man opened an account, and as a result, his account was blocked and the card too. Moreover, they cannot open an account for him as an individual entrepreneur (IP), because for this it is necessary to provide a certificate of registration as an IP. And the Unified State Register of Individual Entrepreneurs in the Unified State Register of Enterprises is not registered, there is a notification procedure, ”said Sergei Zelenov, head of the tax committee of the Moscow branch of the Russian Support. According to him, a client of Sberbank from Ryazan recently encountered such difficulties. Another businessman from Krasnoyarsk said that his personal accounts were blocked due to suspicions of violation of anti-money laundering legislation. In a lawsuit with Sberbank, he is trying to prove that he transferred money to his cards due to the specifics of the business. Having read the conditions for servicing accounts of individuals, the man discovered a strange contradiction: a self-employed citizen can accept money from individuals and legal entities to the account of an individual, using it for business purposes, which is expressly prohibited by law. According to the definition of the Ministry of Justice, self-employed citizens conduct entrepreneurial activities on personal participation. They are not registered as IP, but reported their business to the tax office. However, the federal law does not state that self-employed operations are entrepreneurial activities, unlike individual entrepreneurs. At the same time, multiple transfers from other individuals or companies, characteristic of self-employed, may alarm bank management, and service tariffs for individuals are lower than for entrepreneurs. According to the Federal Tax Service (FTS), by mid-March, the number of self-employed in Russia exceeded 40 thousand people. The head of the department, Mikhail Mishustin, linked success with the advent of a tax on professional income. Starting in 2019, self-employed Russians can switch to a new tax regime subject to a number of conditions. Among them, for example, income of up to 2.4 million rubles per year and operations in four experimental regions. This tax regime can also be chosen by individual entrepreneurs, who, however, will still have to carry out operations on accounts open to individual entrepreneurs. The new fee can be paid using the special mobile application My tax. The FTS press service explained that under the law, self-employed are not required to notify the bank of their status and are not limited in how to receive income: in cash, transfers to an account or to cards. Lawyers say that operations exceeding 2.4 million rubles a year, or 200 thousand rubles a month, do not fall under the control of banks, but the situation may change in the future. According to experts, credit organizations do not formally require self-employed to report on their activities, but they are advised to do so in order to remove the risks associated with not conducting operations on a client’s account. For this, an individual should send a notification to the bank about working with the account in self-employed mode. In addition, banks may at any time require the client to explain the nature of financial transactions under 115-FZ. If the self-employed did not inform the credit institution about his status, the bank will not know for what purpose the account will be used in the future, and atypical operations will immediately cause suspicion that it may become the basis for blocking transactions, remote services, cards and accounts. In the future, the client may be threatened with termination of the banking service agreement and blacklisting. Representatives of Alfa-Bank, Tinkoff Bank, Sovcombank and Rosbank say that the risk of locks is low, and Russian legislation applies to all customers, including self-employed. Alfa-Bank and Tinkoff Bank have already made amendments to their agreements, according to which customer transactions related to entrepreneurial activities using professional income tax are allowed for both individuals and individual entrepreneurs. However, for safety reasons, experts advise opening a separate account to which only business-related income will be received: all proceeds to the selected card will be taken into account as funds from professional activities and the tax will be calculated based on this amount. It is possible that in the future the old service contracts will not be renewed, and new agreements will be offered to the self-employed clients with improved agreements. Recall, the law on tax on self-employed was signed in November last year. Self-employed refers to citizens who do not have an employer and employees, but who provide services or create a product, the income from which is no more than 2.4 million rubles a year, that is, no more than 200 thousand rubles a month. The law entered into force on January 1, 2019 in Moscow, Moscow Region, Kaluga Region and Tatarstan. If the experiment is successful, it will be distributed throughout Russia. The experiment will last until 2029. The law stipulates that self-employed citizens will pay a tax of 4 on income. If the customers of the self-employed are legal entities or individual entrepreneurs, the tax rate will be 6. For the first time, violators of the new tax regime will be charged a fine of 20 from the amount for which the check was not issued (but not less than 1000 rubles). In the event of a relapse, 100 income that has not been officially recorded will be deducted. In this case, only registered self-employed citizens will be fined. A number of exceptions prescribed in the law will not allow people who sell excisable goods and goods subject to mandatory labeling to switch to a new tax regime. Persons engaged in the resale of goods, property rights, as well as those engaged in the extraction or sale of minerals do not fall under the law. In addition, arbitration managers, mediators, appraisers, notaries and private practice lawyers will not be able to transfer to the experiment. Participants in the experiment are exempt from paying personal income tax (PIT) in respect of income derived from professional activities. They also do not pay VAT, with the exception of the situation when goods are imported into the territory of the Russian Federation. It is expected that 63 of the introduced tax will be directed to regional budgets, the remaining 37 to the budget of the Federal MHIF. The tax regime for the self-employed can spread throughout Russia no earlier than 2020. By that time, a special tax regime will gain the status of a separate article in the Tax Code and will no longer be considered an experiment. According to the Tax Code, the services of self-employed include, for example, childcare, cleaning, clothing repair, tutoring, hairdressing, pedicure and manicure at home, guided tours. According to the Ministry of Labor, in Russia there are 12 million self-employed, experts call the figure of 20 million. More: ",0

" Russia is changing the system of economic reporting. Results are improving After several years of declining indicators indicating a decline in living standards in Russia, the Russian state statistics service has suspended the release of its monthly reports on real incomes or adjusted for inflation, The New York Times reports. Economists have already been wary of a service called Rosstat after a new director was appointed in December, shortly after President Vladimir Putin criticized what he called the poor quality of state statistics. A stream of new, optimistic economic data followed. The new director, Pavel Malkov, revised the gross domestic product data for recent years to show, for example, that 2016 was not really a year of recession in Russia, but it showed moderate growth, the article says. Last month, the agency released its estimate of growth in 2018, according to which economic results were the best in six years: growth by 2.3 percent, which is much higher than the unanimous estimate of independent analysts at 1.7 percent. Even economists at Russian state-owned banks were skeptical. The service explained a significant part of the unexpected growth by a random boom in construction in December, the newspaper writes. Rosstat brought many surprises, ”said Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist at BCS Global Markets in a telephone interview. Revised versions and reports with indicators exceeding independent estimates cast doubt on whether this is a purely statistical event or an embellishment of statistics to show a slightly better picture. According to the publication, the cessation of monthly updates on information about real incomes has become a new allusion to the manipulation of statistics. Real incomes have been declining every year since 2014, although in 2018 there would have been a slight increase if it had not been for the one-time bonus paid to pensioners in the previous year. On Wednesday, the service published its first monthly report without real income data, the publication said. - Igor Vagan, a representative of a statistical agency, denies that there is any political motivation behind the change in methodology. The agency now offers to publish revenue data quarterly or annually. ",0

" More than half of Russians do not exclude a delay (56) or a decrease (58) in wages at home or with their family members in the next two to three months, while 8 respondents have already experienced a real delay in payments, and 6 with a decrease in salary. This is evidenced by a survey by the NAFI Analytical Center, published on Thursday, March 21. The likelihood of a delay or a decrease in wages is estimated by Russians differently depending on the type of settlement in which they live. Thus, villagers are most often faced with non-payment of wages: among them, about one in ten (11) noted that their employer had already delayed wages. Residents of Moscow and St. Petersburg more often than others talk about the possibility of reducing the size of the salary (66). A third of Russians (34) noted that over the past three months their acquaintances or relatives have lost their jobs. As in the case of delays in salaries, more often than others, villagers spoke about the dismissals of friends or relatives (41). Opinions of Russians on the difficulty of finding employment in the event of dismissal were divided. Every fifth worker (19) believes that in the event of a loss of current employment, he will easily find himself an equivalent position. Approximately one in four (27) believes that he will find a similar job with little effort, and every third (32) indicated that if this can be done, then with great difficulty. Another 20 noted that it would be almost impossible to find an equivalent job. The most pessimistic are working residents of Moscow and St. Petersburg: 64 believe that if they lose their jobs, it will be difficult or almost impossible to find a similar position. The confidence of Russians in the possibility of finding work in the event of dismissal depends on age. Most respondents aged 18 to 24 believe that they can find a job without problems or with little effort (63). At the same time, almost three-quarters of Russians over 55 years of age (71) do not appreciate their chances of equal employment. A representative All-Russian NAFI survey was conducted in December 2018. Interviewed 1.6 thousand people in 140 settlements of 42 regions of Russia aged 18 years and older. ",0

In the Vinnitsa region for the 11th week, almost 2 times less new cases of measles were recorded than in the previous one.

" Possess the exclusive right to carry out certain economic activities Even on the basis of this definition, nothing prevents the formation of a monopoly in a market in which there is no state influence, it will simply be expressed in your designation to exceed competitors. For example, in a product market a certain company, through investments in R&D, created something that allows their product variations a to exceed very much all their analogues, thereby this company is able to crush the market for itself. Take for the fact that sooner or later some companies that acted on the market and did not close due to difficulties in competition were able to find out what competitors had invented there and put it into their production, but the original author of the study had already managed to grab a significant piece of the market. And even if the copycat company holds out, the likelihood that it will take this dominant share is extremely small but there is. It follows that a monopoly is quite capable of appearing even without a state, and moreover, the natural desire and desire of any company to become a monopolist in its market, and it is this desire that in some way generates competition between market participants.

At the same time, Toronto repeatedly headed the list of the most prosperous cities in the world, and was one of the five safest. Miracles, and only. Probably the wrong non-whites live there. And now selectively compare the level of crime in the US with the whitest and most non-white population. Infa in the public domain, courtesy of F.B.I. and garbage. So, let's start with the most colorful: The State of California reported 445.3 violent crimes and 2,553.0 property crimes per 100,000 inhabitants And now we will go through the states with a predominant white population. For example, Indiana with 86 white people. The State of Indiana reported 404.7 violent crimes and 2,589.4 property crimes per 100,000 inhabitants. As you can see, we ran away from the most colorful and most populated state.

Whether he will be punished under the article on fakes in the media is unknown. paste by reference: Rosstat reported a record industrial growth rate in Russia for almost two years, according to him, the output of industrial enterprises accelerated sharply from 1 percent in January to 4.1 percent in February 2019. The Rosstat’s calculations surprised economists, since the three previous months in the economy showed a gradual slowdown in industrial production. About this newspaper Kommersant. As the publication explains, the data from Rosstat do not meet the expectations of economists, or even survey leading indicators of the statistical department itself. Analysts, however, note that if seasonal and calendar effects are taken into account, there has been no increase in industrial production since the beginning of the year. MATERIALS ON TOPIC 00:01 March 11 Healthy fall Why economic crises save millions of lives, but so many people die because of them The Higher School of Economics (HSE) made its own calculations based on crude statistics, took into account seasonal factors and concluded in February 2019, no increase in the rate of industrial production in the Russian economy was observed at all. The HSE explained that in February 2019 there was one more working day than in February 2018, hence the appearance of production growth. At the same time, the HSE noted that if the calculations still take into account the seasonal effect and calendar, then it turns out that industrial production for two months not only does not grow, but decreases noticeably. Rosstat has repeatedly been criticized for inaccurate calculations. So, according to the results of 2018, the department announced a growth of the construction industry in Russia by 5.3 percent, although back in November the annual growth rate was estimated at only 0.5 percent. These high indicators then allowed the Ministry of Economic Development to estimate GDP growth at the end of the year not by 1.8 percent, as predicted, but by 2. Analysts criticized these figures and found them fictitious. The methodology of Rosstat was also criticized by First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov, saying that the quality of the agency’s calculations is terrible, and the method is opaque. Since 2017, Rosstat has been subordinate to the Ministry of Economic Development, which is headed by Maxim Oreshkin. The department from 2009 to 2018 was headed by Alexander Surinov. In December 2018, he resigned, he was replaced by a former official of the Ministry of Economic Development Pavel Malkov. ",0

" This is when demand equals supply. If you increase demand without increasing supply (and raise it expensively), then you will suffer losses, as buyers simply go to other coffee houses, even if the price there is slightly higher. Again, we return to the fact that libertarians live in the 19th century where the laws of supply and demand work. In the real world, everything is no longer so and megacorporations themselves can create demand for their goods. Easy example is Coca-Cola and Facebook. The production of pops for cola rises in a penny, this is a marketing company. 80 of all expenses go to marketing and promoting the idea that people NEED pop, when a fairly large number of people hooked, pop started replacing plain bottled water. That is, the need of people for water CONVERTED to the need of people for pop. Now often people buy Coke, not because they want it, but because they want to drink and everything is forced by Coke. Facebook, oh facebook, Zeckerberg is really a genius. His idea is to have poor but densely populated countries surf the Internet on Facebook. Specifically, we are talking about India. In 2018, the number of users from India on Facebook exceeds the number of users from the United States. Why is that? Because Zuckerberg takes and leads the line to impoverished Indians, but limits the traffic ONLY to Facebook. That is, for the Indians, Facebook is the Internet. Zuckerberg CONVERTED the need of a huge number of people on the Internet to the need for facebook, thus creating new customers for themselves, which, as a result, will bring much more money than was spent on them. In the modern world, demand does not give rise to supply, everything is much more complicated and there are many dependencies of supply and demand. However, the fact that multibillion-dollar companies can generate demand for their goods themselves speaks of the senselessness of all that garbage that you offer. ",0

" On the island of Kunashir, the creation of a modern enterprise for the production of fishmeal and fish oil continues. In Yuzhno-Kurilsk, builders have completed laying the foundation of a future building, pouring floors and are starting to install load-bearing metal structures. The project was financially supported by the Regional Development Institute, the Sakhalin Oblast Development Corporation established by the island authorities. The company on preferential terms funded the manufacture in Thailand of high-tech equipment for two production lines of the future workshop. During the peak period, they are able to process up to 504 tons of raw materials per day. At the end of November last year, the cargo arrived on the island. Further construction of the shop building will be carried out in parallel with the installation and commissioning of production equipment, said Konstantin Korobkov, Director General of PKF LLC Yuzhno-Kurilsky Fish Plant. The launch should take place before the end of 2019. With the launch of the new production at full capacity in 2021, the annual contribution of PKF Yuzhno-Kurilsky Fish Plant LLC to the gross regional product will grow to 1.7 billion rubles. Tax revenues to the regional budget will increase to 92 million rubles. At the factory, 46 new jobs will be created. ",0

" And you think why the Nazis came to power? Looking at all the atrocities in the east, perpetrated by Jews, the Germans were ready to allow the most zealous radicals to rule, if only there wasn’t what is happening now. Woe to the vanquished - do you know such a maxim? The Russians lost in 1921, the Germans lost in 1945. Now they are reaping the benefits. By the way, the Germans themselves are to blame for this, because they used a vile trick against RI in the war - they launched Jewish radicals there and generously financed. As a result, a year later they received the November revolution. Or remember the German chancellor, who put Merkel under him, fearing the competition of men. How did she repay him and what is she doing with Germany for the sake of maintaining power? Or remember the politicians who gave women rights for the sake of additional votes and maintaining power in the short term. What did it spill over now? Vile methods in politics have ruined this world. The nits in power ruined him, destroying the foundation. Each such vile trick rolls the world into shit, regardless of the scale of the act. ",1

The head of the American delegation noted significant progress on these two points ... ... According to the requirements of the Taliban, the United States abandoned the prerequisites associated with the Taliban’s obligations to begin a political process with the Kabul government.

" While the pilots of the doomed Boeing planes in Ethiopia and Indonesia tried to regain control, they did not have two important safety features that Boeing sold for an additional fee, writes the NY Times. Like other aircraft manufacturers, Boeing makes a profit by upgrading aircraft for the individual needs of the customer. Sometimes these optional features include advanced design and comfort: premium seats, fancy lighting or extra toilets. But communication, navigation and security systems are also sold for an additional fee. Many airlines, especially low-cost carriers, such as the Indonesian Lion Air, do not buy these features, and regulators do not require them to be available. Now, after two disasters, Boeing will make standard one of these safety features as part of an aircraft software update. It is still unknown what caused the crash of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 on March 10 and Lion Air flight 610 five months ago. Experts suggest that partial fault lies with the new software that was added to the Boeing 737 Max. Incorrect sensor data may have caused the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) to malfunction. In October 2018, the Lion Air airliner crashed off the west coast of Java, killing 189 people. After analyzing the black box data, the experts were very surprised by the strange behavior of the MCAS system. Apparently, the sensors received incorrect data on the angle of attack and the plane automatically lowered its nose and headed straight into the water. Pilots more than ten times tried to manually raise their nose, but the system still lowered it down. As a result, the liner hit the water and crashed. On March 10, another aircraft crashed in Ethiopia, injuring 149 passengers and eight crew members. On March 13, 2019, after consulting with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and its customers, Boeing issued an official recommendation to all airlines to temporarily suspend the Boeing 737 Max. In the next few weeks, the company promises to update the flight management system software. ... ",0

" Blogger Emily Hartridge (Emily Hartridge) said that many years of frustration with dating on the network led to the fact that she froze her eggs. According to the tabloid The Sun, so the woman wanted to take control of her future motherhood. The 34-year-old woman admitted that she turned to online dating after her last serious relationship ended. She tried to improve her personal life since 2011, but she only spent eight years being deceived by hopeless men. The blogger clarified that in the early years she was not worried because of the passing time. However, she later decided that she should freeze her eggs in case she did not meet a suitable guy: I could not ignore the idea that this could not happen, Hartridge admitted. The girl talked about her decision to her mother, and she offered to pay for an expensive procedure. In the clinic, Hartridge found out that she had extremely low fertility, her chances of a natural pregnancy were very small. Hartridge family cost 15 thousand pounds (almost 1.3 million rubles) to treat and preserve the eggs. Two weeks before the first procedure, the blogger met a 27-year-old guy named Jake. He supported her and even accompanied her to the clinic. Despite the fact that the girl had a boyfriend, she does not regret her choice. Hartridge hopes that the eggs stored in the freeze will save her if she breaks up with her boyfriend or if she cannot become pregnant due to fertility problems. ",0

" Citigroup Inc. plans to sell several tons of gold provided by the Central Bank of Venezuela as collateral for a loan of 1.6 billion after the expiration of their repurchase date this month. It is reported by Reuters, citing sources. Since 2014, Venezuelan authorities have used financial transactions, known as gold swaps, to gain access to cash after a fall in oil revenues. However, in the past two years, President Nicolas Maduro has struggled to return the gold issued as security. According to the terms of the 2015 deal with Citibank, Venezuela was supposed to repay 1.1 billion on March 11, told Reuters interlocutors who were familiar with the situation. The remainder of the loan must be paid next year. The market value of gold, which Citibank plans to sell, is approximately 1.36 billion. According to sources, the bank uses 1.1 billion of them to repay part of the loan. Another 258 million will be placed in a bank account in New York. Recall that a deep political crisis continues in Venezuela due to the fact that the unrecognized president Nicolas Maduro does not want to give up power to Juan Guaido, who is supported by most of the countries of the West and the USA.

I’ve been sitting here with you for many years and obscuring fagots even though I myself am one of them, laughing at their deaths, making photo-frogs with monkeys. I thought it was done by Russian Russophobes and Ukrainians, who are 10 percent, so I did not regard it as anything else than self-criticism, self-irony or just indignation because of the war in the Donbass (in the end, I consider Ukrainians to be my brothers and their bugurt not unreasonable). But the fuck dawned on me when the badges were first returned, and then the mosque was shot in NZ. Here to the heap of fucking muslims and they do it with us (I thought they were too hopelessly stupid to be interested in politics). They call Russian fagots, Slavshchit. Fuck, do you really think you're better than fuckers? And generally the Slavs? Well, I agree that Caucasian men often look better than Russians. But for the rest, you’re much worse than even fagots who live surrounded by shit and don’t smell when, in the morning, leaving the entrance to work, they enter ten-centimeter dirt, considering this the norm; who have no solidarity on any grounds, hate each other a priori, even abandon their children like fucking blacks, who would rather hand you over to the bosses for the looming reward (which they won’t give them) if you try to knock people out on strike because of non-payment of wages for half a year; cowardly and patient cattle, which the gentleman extols and divides people into castes on the basis of the presence and coolness of the ass truck; fucking fuckers who extol their scumbag scoop, who invented everything in the world and the americans stole !! 11, but in fact it turns out that the scoop practically didn’t build and didn’t upgrade, either according to western projects with the consent of the west, or with the help of technological espionage. Truly a people-pus, people-fag, people-scum, the most vile people in the world. But even against the backdrop of fagots you look like germs, you are just fucking insignificance, and I'm not trying to offend you, my words really reflect the original meaning embedded in them, you are nothing. Yes, fagots are exactly the same as I described them above, they are uberchevy, but they are the bottom of civilized nations, while you cannot even be attributed to these civilized nations. They even invented something, and if they didn’t invent it, they were able to tweak and recreate technology and not just some can opener, but nuclear weapons and energy, they created the literature that is valued in the world, created albeit cunning, militarized, built on lies and blood, oppression and humiliation of their own citizens, and ultimately collapsed, but a superpower, made a lot of geographical discoveries and captured half the world, now they bring up a lot of good coders (though they are probably brought up not because of, but contrary to when they see what the fuck is around and find from it such output). Not to mention the rest of the Slavs, whom you contemptuously call here Slavschit and cleaners of British toilets. But in fact, we certainly are shit, in comparison with the countries of the first world, with China, the South Caucasus and Japan, even with the countries of South America. But you are a whore even among the Rashkin regions is the bottom. In the past, you (Chechens, Dagi and other varieties) were just savages who attacked Russian caravans and that’s why they decided to fuck you and seize you. And if we talk about the Central Asians, who have been bugging since the occupation, then you were ordinary poor nomads, wiped with a stone and drinking camel urine, without names of peoples. Now everyone is afraid of you because if a fag makes a couple of holes in you, protecting himself, then they will put him on a bottle, and if you kill a fag, you won’t be fucking. And there is an opinion that this was done specifically so that the Russian was brought up by a humble slave. You are humiliating Russian children at school, because you are aggressive monkeys who are not capable of dialogue and ignite with the slightest spark, and let someone here give me a hint about the Protopopian crap, the children at school should study, be inspired and choose a future profession, and not fight for survival and moronic status in the hierarchy. And do not listen to the morons from b, humiliation and beating of the weak does not make you better than those you humiliate, does protection. I do not like to use Natsik phrases, but for centuries you really just sat in the mountains and fucked rams, even you fagot people could capture you.

Where are the states, cultures? Why is there no work at all in Central Asian parashas and they all go not to Rashka, but to work abroad in Asian countries?

" In Krivoy Rog in the Interregional center for the retraining of retired military personnel, an emergency occurred. An eighteen-year-old boy received a fatal injury in an attempt to get over the fence into a hostel while being drunk. This was reported by the publication All Kryvyi Rih. After drinking alcohol at night on March 19, his comrades brought him, drunk, to the college dormitory, but it was already closed. The guy had to be dragged over a metal fence and in the process he was injured. The student himself told the nurse about this. The school medical officer examined the student the next morning and repaired the damage. The wounds did not pay much attention and considered it insignificant. A few hours later the victim became ill. His comrades called an ambulance. Doctors hospitalized the student in critical condition. He was immediately operated on at the hospital. It turned out that his heart ventricle was hurt, the publication informs. After the operation, the victim was in intensive care in serious condition, in a coma of the third degree and on mechanical ventilation, and on the morning of March 21 he died. The guy came to study at the Interregional Center from a village in the Kherson region. The guy has no parents, only his sister remains. Krivoy Rog police opened a criminal investigation into the death of a person. ",0

" sorry for the sheet, it’s boring on the road) One of my classmates thought that factories with a tangible product were the only good business. But if you look at the rich countries, the share of the service sector there is higher than in the countries of the poor. And it is right. In general, the movement of money drives the economy. In the USSR, it was believed that speculators - it is immoral. But what does a speculator do? It resells - it gives the consumer to feel the goods, gives a guarantee, transports the goods from point A to point B. And this is good. For business, value added is profit. Business can be different - services, production, trade. Apart from all sorts of schemes with kickbacks, and other artificial increase in value (as in the case of a monopoly), the business is trying to make a price at which it gets the maximum profit at which they are ready to buy from it. A business goes bankrupt if it cannot maintain a price lower than its competitors because of, for example, too high costs, or because in country A taxes are 2 times higher than in country B. Well, or it puts a high price and focuses on quality. Business is any business activity aimed at making a profit. No profitable activity, no profit. ",0

" The point is not in checks, but in the fact that even local media and those who are going to punish these seller-violators inside the church environment can even buy a video proof of such events from you. The non-withdrawability of funds from the institution of the church is the first point of fundamental difference. Non-ownership of funds by a specific group of individuals of possible anti-state intruders is the second point (hierarchy and inheritance are much tougher than civil-property transfer of property). The saved reporting from each post throughout the church hierarchy is the third paragraph (a la built-in FAS). Church organizations engaged in the production of any kind of utensils and accessories have only this production line and do not interact with the general market - the fourth point. The intra-church market, in principle, does not make tangible contacts with, for example, the all-Russian market, except for a few lines, such as the purchase of certain Cahors, while the conclusion is not made at all - the fifth point. Since this is a sacrificial type of cost compensation, in order to avoid malicious intermediaries who can earn by buying from the church market with subsequent, more expensive resale to the regular market, prices of church products slightly exceed the acceptable minimum resale threshold, which ensures the preservation of the boundaries between church and the usual market is the sixth point.

" To learn a doctor is a task of 16-18 years (school 11 years, 4-7 years medical institute). And still it is necessary to take from those who will train, these are teachers. If the education in the ass is declining, even with the availability of money, there will be a shortage of skilled labor. A business, an entrepreneur, will never make plans for 20 years in advance. There is no benefit to this. He will undertake this only with the state. financing. And this is the task of state planning: to build schools, education for decades to come. If education dies, all sectors die, because specialists are aging, new ones do not appear. This is not a question of money, it is a question primarily of public policy. And in capitalism, no one seeks to make treatment accessible to the whole population. Treatment will be received by those who have money for it. And so you do not need to keep a large staff of honey. staff to cover the entire population. The fact that this can lead to problems in the future, such as the refusal of vaccinations, has led to an outbreak of measles in Ukraine - the capitalists are not worried. Only when there is a real threat that the working population is suffering, dying and the income from it is falling, will any infusion into medicine begin. They will always keep medicine at a level - so that they can work, and then let them die. There is no question of any reduction in the working day. Where regular personnel are required (emergency services), to reduce the workload for employees, you just need to hire more staff. And this is a big salary cost.

" Hello, for a start a small excursion into history: One of the categories of commandments to the people about the Jerusalem Temple was the commandments of the offering of kosher animals on the occasion of a very different reason. And because if it suddenly turned out that the animal was defective inside, then such an offering was not considered an offering. Therefore, those who came from distant lands to Jerusalem were given the opportunity to buy the right animal directly near the place of offering, and this was not forbidden. However, after some time, even the nearest lands ceased to bring, translating the command of the living offering into a virtually inanimate equivalent. And an episode from the Christian scriptures says that Jesus drove away these sellers of calves and pigeons, who, sitting in the walls of the Temple, contributed to this kind of violation of the commandment about offerings. If we take into account the successive tradition of the Christian church, and also pay attention that believers do not have personal pastures of cows, sheep, dovecotees, their current fruit of labor can not only be equivalent to money, as then, but it is money that is converted into a more acceptable , for doing anything in temples, kind.

" The sadness is that there is often such an item: The manufacturer reserves the right to change the characteristics of the product, its appearance and completeness without prior notice to the seller. I didn’t see such an item on the CSN site, and at Citylink it is written under each item. And in practice, you can buy two identical models of the device, but they can vary. And to prove something in this case is very difficult if the product is technically sound. I was so unlucky when long ago I took the motherboard for a nettop media player. From the beginning, such a mother was taken by a friend for a media player, and his S-Video output worked from the BIOS, and when I bought the same motherboard, but in a new revision, S-Video worked when switching to Windows. In CSN they shook hands, maybe the goods are working, but it’s hard to identify the output of a picture from the BIOS via S-Video as a break, maybe on the Intel website there’s not a word about it, but everything is fine on VGA. So before buying a modern TV, this motherboard worked in a torrent rocking chair. There was no point in returning and receiving money either: there were no alternatives on the market, and it is more convenient to download torrents on a small nettop than a large computer would do.

At its core, capitalism and communism is a modern analogue of building an antique army in battle. Only the battle is not on swords, but on money. Indeed, money in its essence is a way to satisfy unlimited human desires in the conditions of severe limited resources, valuable means of transforming human genius and labor into a resource. But sooner or later, technological progress will lead to the fact that resources will not be limited and will be able to satisfy the unlimited desires of those who possess these resources, and therefore there will be no need to convert labor into value. This means that one day the owners of our global technogenic civilization, those who are now so passionately and zealously driving us towards the light along the stage, fortunately under the whips, will leave us out of necessity. And everything will be repeated, as in old days: War of the gods, Olympus, pharmacy, street, lantern. ",0

" Evidence for the theory of relativity can be found in school textbooks. How interesting!!! I would not be so categorical. You’d better go deeper into the topic. By the 100th anniversary of SRT and the 90th anniversary of GR coinciding with it, it was discovered that neither theory has been experimentally confirmed! On the occasion of the anniversary, the $ 760 million Gravity Probe B (GP-B) project was launched, which was supposed to give at least one confirmation of these ridiculous theories, but it all ended in great embarrassment. The data obtained during the experiment using Gravity Probe B (GP-B), in fact, were adjusted to the desired values ​​in order to get the right answer. Opinion the first academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences Zhuravlyov: There is an opinion that so far there have been two confirming the theory of general theory of commentary ed. fact: redshift and perihelion precession of Mercury. In fact, this is not so. The redshift can also be explained in the framework of the special theory of relativity, and to explain the displacement of the perihelion of Mercury it is enough to take into account the dipole moment of the gravitational field of the Sun, abandoning the assumption that the Sun is a uniform ball. Thus, the experiment completed last year is so far the only reliable confirmation of the GRT Report on some details of the unique Gravity Probe B experiment. We make two comments about the statement of academician Zhuravlev. First remark. An attentive reader may notice: why the academician did not mention the well-known confirmation of general relativity by the curvature of a ray of light in the gravitational field of the Sun, for example, the apparent displacement of stars during a solar eclipse? And he did not mention this confirmation because this widely known fact in the narrow scientific community to mention indecently widely advertised confirmation was the result of obvious fraud and incorrect manipulation of the results of scientific experiments. Second remark. Zhuravlyov admitted that as a result of the experiment, GTR finally received the first (in 90 years of existence!) Experimental confirmation. Here we ask ourselves: did Zhuravlev check the calculations that had been done at Stanford for almost five years and were not brought to the end due to the fact that NASA finally ran out of patience, and it stopped further funding for an explicit fit of the results answer? Would anyone give Zhuravlev the similar funds that the research team at Stanford gave, and which these guys did not have enough to further improve data analysis? Opinion second academician of the USSR Academy of Sciences Logunov: Today's attitude to this theory of general relativity approx. ed. heavily based on faith.

" When separating the paratrooper from the aircraft, the parachute system is activated by forcibly opening the satchel and pulling the cover from the dome with a pull rope fixed with a carbine inside the aircraft. Under the influence of the weight of the paratrooper, the exhaust rope is pulled out and strikes the knapsack valve, then it pulls the cover attached to the end loop to the full length. The cover comes out of the satchel, and the slings from the honeycomb cover. After pulling the slings over the entire length, the breakage slings are destroyed and the cover is pulled off the canopy. The parachute is filled with a free stream. Covers worn on the free ends of the suspension system and the corresponding line groups reduce the chance that the parachutist kicks into the lines of the parachute with improper separation from the aircraft. The drop in the parachutist occurs on a filled parachute. The draw rope and cover remain in the aircraft. There is no device on the main dome. Only on the spare. ",0

" There was a similar situation with Aeroflot, but with a happy ending. I bought a ticket for the Surgut-Moscow flight with a departure at 7-00 in the morning. The flight was NOT registered in advance. Since I myself am from Kogalym (it is 185 km from Surgut), it turned out that by the end of registration I was late for exactly two minutes (I was at the reception at 6-22). After asking what to do, I was sent to the ticket office to check in as a late passenger, and I, paying for this service at a cost of 1,500 rubles, came back to the check-in counter. Further, the situation developed similarly to that described in the post, with small nuances. The employee behind the counter flatly refused to check in for my flight and let me into the plane. But we are not too fast-witted, we know a little about the law on consumer rights, and we read Pikabu regularly. So, having pulled out of my pocket a check about the service paid for one and a half thousand rubles, I asked to invite the senior shift and in paints (waving the check) explained to him that if I was not put on the plane, I would leave an entry in the airport’s complaints and suggestions book, along the way a complaint to the consumer protection department of Surgut, and a complaint about off. Aeroflot website. And all because they sold the service, and later did not want to provide it. In general, they planted at 6-50 ten minutes before departure.

" Libertarians are considering a world where resources are unlimited, and this is not so. No no and one more time no. They distribute resources according to the principles of the free market. Without regulation, resources are deposited by the one who has more money, the ability to squeeze this resource. More money, yes. If you can’t buy more goods for more money (provided that you do not buy the last unit of goods), then why the hell do you need this money? The ability to wring out a resource - if you mean the use of force, then libertarianism is just against it. By the way, if the market is regulated, then the resources will still settle. But not among the rich, but among those who redistribute these resources. Not to mention that the rich at least did something to get more resources. According to libertarianism, each commune is free to set its own rules, but if people upstream decided not to build treatment facilities because they do not need them, then downstream people will bathe in the shit of those who are higher. And the people of the commune from below the river will come to the libertarian court, lay out proofs about who owns the enterprise and how it harms them, and then the owner gets fucked in the ass. Not if the monopoly is based on the fact that the monopolist has taken all the resources. This is an occasion to look for alternatives. Big Oil has appropriated all the gas. What have people done? They put a dick on this very gasoline and began to buy kerosene, Big Oil began to deflate. The market decided. There is still such a joke as the difficulty of entering the market. A good remark, no doubt. But there are many different mechanisms on the market. For example, you can collect the investments of any gamers who are overwhelmed by overpriced processors. This same Vasyan for the money of gamers establishes his company, hires people and ebashit good processors. the monopolist’s ability to work at a loss This, obviously, cannot go on forever, because the money will someday run out. For this reason, state monopolies are dangerous - their money is not limited, because a hole in the budget is shut up by taxpayer money. In the free market, the monopolist will have to sacrifice something in the hope of conquering a large part of the market, which may not happen. And, again, the freedom of small business. ",0

" Beijing, March 21, Xinhua - A demonstration prototype developed in China by an unmanned aerial vehicle based on new energy sources, known as the LQ-H, successfully completed its first flight. This was announced on Wednesday by Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China COMAC, which is the developer of a new device. To demonstrate its technology, the LQ-H flew at one of the airports in Zhengzhou, Henan, Central China, said COMAC, which also developed the domestic large-size passenger aircraft C919. It is reported that the flight that LQ-H made on a hydrogen fuel cell went smoothly with the correct operation of all systems that were in good condition. At the same time, the UAV power supply system from the batteries was fully tested. According to the COMAC Corporation, this was a significant progress for them in the development of aircraft using new energy sources. The wingspan of the LQ-H is 6 meters, it is equipped with a hydrogen fuel cell as the main energy source, as well as a lithium battery as an additional power source. In the production of the demonstration model of the new UAV, several new technologies were used, such as 3D printing and composite materials, in order to reduce the weight of the device and stimulate the use of new technologies in further production.

" From April 19 in Nikolaev there will be a ban on the passage of heavy vehicles on the Yuzhnobugsky (Varvarovsky) bridge. Such a decision was made by the executive committee of the Nikolaev city council at a meeting on Friday, March 22. During the discussion of the draft decision, a discussion erupted. The head of the trade union committee of the Nikolaev factory of reinforced concrete products Svetlana Boyko noted that such a decision would have great economic consequences. “We all understand that the bridge is in disrepair and needs to be repaired,” said a company representative. “But, making this decision right now, one should think whether a normal economically feasible bypass option for freight transport is provided.” You can ban at any time. And then what? How will industrial enterprises work? She agreed that the statutory norm for the transportation of 40 tons of cargo by one vehicle represents a heavy load for the bridge. - But at the moment there is no crossing, no pontoon, no other way out. And you all understand that nobody will travel through Voznesensk to Odessa. Firstly, it is economically unreasonable very high costs. Secondly, there is also a bridge in disrepair and there is also a very bad road, ”said Svetlana Boyko. She asked either to postpone this question until the crossing is established, or to make a decision in such a way that it would not affect local enterprises, in other words, to allow them to use this bridge, and to direct the transit flow to bypass. The mayor of Nikolaev Alexander Senkevich noted that the bridge is not just emergency, but incapable. The Commission for Emergencies generally banned its operation. People who move along it are at risk: a bridge with them can simply fall. - Today, a sign hangs on the bridge, which limits the cargo to 20 tons. There is another sign hanging that vehicles are allowed with a distance of 70 meters. Have you seen anyone keep this distance? Trucks go one by one. Near the yacht club and hotel. Being there in the room, you can feel the vibration. I’m not talking about people who live in houses located near the bridge, - said Alexander Senkevich. According to him, other Nikolaev enterprises, alarmed by the prospect of blocking the bridge, turned to the city authorities. And their concerns are understandable. The delivery of raw materials and products will cost them very dearly. - On the other hand, we cannot but make this decision today. After all, while we will solve the issue of a ferry or pontoon crossing, this bridge may fall apart. And then not only business, but also ordinary people who live in the residential districts of Varvarovka, Malaya and Bolshaya Korenikha will not be able to drive it. They will not be able to drive to get to the hospital elementarily, ”the mayor explained. Executive Committee member Alexander Trifonov tried to understand how this process would be physically implemented. In other words, how long will it take to create a detour that enterprises can use. Oleg Kuksa, deputy head of the transport complex, communications and telecommunications department, replied that the Road Service is developing a detour scheme. But there was no answer to Vladimir Timoshin's persistent questions about how this scheme would look on the map, where exactly the freight transport would be taken. - We will now make a decision to ban the movement of the bridge for heavy vehicles. That's right: the bridge is emergency, and Varvarovka will thank us very much for the lack of freight transport. But tomorrow, the Salt will thank us very much, because all transport will go from there. And exactly six months later we will raise the question of closing the Ingul bridge, because all transport will go through the Ingul bridge, ”Vladimir Timoshin laid out on the shelves. To this, Kuksa replied that according to the scheme developed by the Road Service, freight transport would be allowed to bypass Nikolaev and would not even call into the city. Timoshin said that in addition to transit transport, there is also one that carries grain to ports and elevators. And all these 60 tons will go through Salt, as Varvarovka will be closed. In turn, Deputy Mayor Yuri Stepanets, who previously oversaw transport issues, noted that two years ago the executive committee adopted a traffic management scheme, according to which heavy trucks were not supposed to go either through the Varvarovsky or through the Ingulsky bridge. Only one entry from the Bashtansky highway, along Novozavodskaya and Kuznechnaya (Skorokhodova), was determined at city enterprises. But Timoshin added: the key phrase was not to be. Despite the ban, they continued to move. - Unfortunately, we do not have control functions. We are not standing at the weighing complexes and we cannot check how and with what load cars enter the city, ”the vice mayor complained. - Now Ukrtransbespek is trying to take all this. Nevertheless, they must come to this scheme and force the heavy trucks to enter only from the direction so that the bridges do not collapse. As a result, the decision to close the Varvarov bridge for heavy vehicles was made by a majority vote of the members of the executive committee with one against and three abstentions. ",0

" Walt Disney's $ 71.3 billion acquisition of Wst Disney will turn the six children of tycoon Rupert Murdoch, who controls this media holding, into billionaires. According to Bloomberg Business News Agency, the tycoon’s children will distribute 12 billion received from the deal. According to the agency, Murdoch’s fortune after closing the deal will reach 19.3 billion, but will decrease immediately to 7.3 billion after the transfer of the above-mentioned share to his children. It is expected that the new company New Fox will be formed, combining the broadcaster Fox Broadcasting, regional television stations Fox TV, as well as cable channels Fox Sports and Fox News. Their former shareholders were offered a choice of Walt Disney stocks, cash, or both. The form of payment will determine the taxation procedure for participants in the transaction in the United States, Bloomberg explains. As CNBC previously reported, Disney still needs to get approval from regulators in several countries. The full deal is expected to be completed in the spring of 2019. Previously, it was approved by the US Department of Justice, the European Commission and China. In December 2017, Disney announced its readiness to acquire 21st Century Fox assets for 52.4 billion, offering to pay this amount in shares. In June 2018, the US telecommunications conglomerate Comcast announced that it was ready to pay more - 65 billion, and not in shares, but in cash. Disney representatives soon outperformed Comcast, raising rates to 71.3 billion. ",0

Well, excuse me, computers and phones did not immediately fall into the hands of the middle class. Due to technological progress, production becomes cheaper and better, and if you have a complete monopoly, then you either lose money trying to regulate the markets (without selling goods for which there is no demand due to the fucking price, as a result it is idle until there will not be a second manufacturer), or you lower the price to come to the point of equilibrium. So at first, of course, there will be no talk of any quantum computers for the middle class, but over time, everything will appear. ",0

An alien (1982), as well as a Jurassic Park, he was nominated for an Oscar many times, but, like in the case of Scorsese, he received nothing. But as soon as he shot a film dedicated to the Holocaust (Schindler's List), they instantly thrust him the long-awaited award for both the best director and the best film. Moreover, the prize was awarded bypassing the much more powerful work of cinema - today famous Philadelphia. It is very significant that the List was originally released only in a limited (!) Rental, and did not receive any noticeable audience attention, but as soon as he received political Oscars, his rental increased by 89 in a month! Of the above Spielberg films, Schindler is truly the best. And Philadelphia is a very cool movie. ",0

" The 24-year-old resident of the Gorodishchensky district at first had fun in the bath, and when young people refused to take her home, she turned to law enforcement officers. In social networks, the girl met two guys and during the correspondence agreed to a meeting. On the evening of March 18, two gentlemen of 25 and 28 years old kindly drove for a lady and went to one of the Volzhsky baths. Here, the trio indulged in not only bathing, but also carnal joys, while the girl took a promise from the guys that they would take her home. However, the divorced boyfriends did not keep their promise and offered a resident of the Settlement to go by minibus or hitchhikers. The girl had no money with her, and then she called the police and reported the rape. Arriving law enforcement officers explained to the girl that if a citizen, after proximity, has claims to partners, then you need to write a statement, but for this you need to prove the violent nature of the actions, otherwise it will result in a false denunciation of rape. - I can only confirm that the investigation department in Volzhsky is conducting an audit on the above events. We cannot disclose any details of this story yet, - said Alexander Minaev, deputy head of the CO for the Volzhsky SU of the Investigative Committee for the Volgograd Region, to NovostiVolgograd.ru. Thus, the girl was trapped, because the connection was voluntary, and for the optionalness of the suitors you cannot be held criminally liable. According to unofficial information, after clarifying the alleged victim to all legal formalities, she refused to write a rape statement. ",0

" And now everyone is looking at garbage with pidoras zvonov, In justification of pidoras Zvonov, you can at least say that the latter just did content on the chma on the streams: starting from going to sport, new guests, scientific videos, ending with a parody of What Where When. In general, after the end of the summer, I somehow rethought my attitude to many members of the disabled conference, and to the Marginal himself. He often uses the content and talents of his guests, inviting them for fucking for streams. At the same time, he cocks them behind his back and on other streams, because of which everything that guests ultimately receive in return for joint streams is shit from marginal subscribers in their feed. And at the same time, the Marginal has the audacity to then whine that none of the normal people want to go to him on a stream when he sees his wall. It does not occur to him that by encouraging toxicity towards his opponents and guests on streams, although he acquires an aura of intellectual streamer, draining of everyone and everyone living in Russia, in the end he is more and more pupils in his own argumentation and audience. Notice that those with whom he debated and argued a year ago just now avoid disputes on the streams, just not even clogging his tape (Levin is the clearest example. Or, excuse me, Zvonov). Previously, Margosha was capable of self-irony thanks to the same ubermemes, where Marginal’s jambs were also noticed, but with the kick of Leo Shoigu, the pupation process simply began. Now hooing the Marginal is forbidden, it is forbidden to even discuss and notice the dullness of the marginal. Because, as the schmuck says: influences views, ololo. In fact, forbidding to stain your reputation, but continuing to stain the reputation of others (both friends and enemies), the schmuck is now trying, consciously or not, to build the image of a kind of intellectual-draining person, what Larin dreamed of becoming. Only Marginal has not yet earned this image. It’s not enough just to say, well, it's just your definition of fucked, he’s a fool, yes, fucked up in response to argument. If earlier, moreover, it was a rarity, now Marginal is completely lazy and is just discussing under the hooting of an anally moderated chat room. Safe space is such a safe space. ",1

" Silicon EL Group launched in Bryansk the serial production of transistors and microchips with design standards of 500 nanometers for digital technology: smartphones, laptops, cameras and other equipment. Earlier, the Industrial Development Fund (FRF) provided the company with a soft loan for the implementation of this project. As part of the project, Silicon EL Group launched a new serial production of transistors and integrated circuits with design standards of 500 nanometers in small-sized cases that are used in secondary power supply units of various digital equipment, for example, laptops, smartphones, cameras and car DVRs. In addition, the company launched the production of secondary power supervisor microchips. By 2022, the company plans to release transistors and microchips in the amount of more than 825 million rubles. The main consumers of finished products will be PTZ Telta equipment manufacturers, Vega Radio Engineering Concern, as well as Almaz-Antey, Constellation, Aircraft Instrument Making, Roskosmos, Rosatom Concerns. At the moment, the share of foreign manufacturers in the market of transistors and integrated circuits in microcases that are used in secondary power supply units, according to the company, exceeds 95. Due to the implementation of the project, this indicator will drop to 30. At present, Russia does not have a modern competitive production of integrated circuits and transistors for digital technology. That is why the domestic market is almost 100 dependent on foreign suppliers. Thanks to support from the FRP, we will be able to replace foreign products and provide Russian manufacturers with high-quality domestic microcircuits and transistors, said Oleg Dantsev, general director of the Silicon EL Group. In 2017, the FRP provided a loan to the Bryansk manufacturer in the amount of 200 million rubles under the Conversion program. The Silicon EL Group project was the first open production within the framework of this program in the region, launched with the help of a FRP loan. The total investment in production amounted to more than 400 million rubles. Using preferential means, the company acquired modern high-tech equipment, including a scanning electron microscope, a multi-channel measuring system, a deposition and development system, a maskless alignment and exposure unit, and an assembly line. The use of modern equipment made it possible to reach a higher technological level, improve the quality, time and frequency characteristics of products, reduce the defect rate, reduce the size of the crystal, and reduce the complexity and material consumption of manufacturing. The company plans to master the new serial production of integrated circuits and transistors: with design standards of 350 nanometers, already for more complex products. ",0

" The approval rating for the work of Russian President Vladimir Putin as of March 17 showed a maximum since the beginning of 2019, it exceeded the threshold of 65, this is stated in a study by the All-Russian Center for the Study of Public Opinion (VTsIOM). The approval indicator of the president’s activities on average from March 11 to 17 was positively adjusted to 65.3 - the maximum over the past six months, according to a study published on the VTsIOM website. It is noted that the work of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and the government also increased and amounted to 38 and 41, respectively. In the confidence rating, the president’s indicator was 33.4 on average for the week of March 11-17. The second and third positions in the list appear behind the head of the Ministry of Defense Sergey Shoigu (14.7) and the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov (11.7). The leader in distrust remains Vladimir Zhirinovsky: almost a quarter of respondents (23.5) would not have entrusted him with the solution of important state issues, the release notes. VTsIOM-Sputnik initiative all-Russian polls were conducted from January to March 2019, and citizens over 18 took part in them. As a method, a telephone interview was used on a stratified two-base random sample of landline and mobile numbers. The maximum error size with a probability of 95 does not exceed for data collected over seven days (11,200 people), 1. ",0

" Novaya Gazeta journalists analyzed a large array of Russian court decisions and found that in some texts the texts almost completely coincided, with the exception of names and small details. This does not allow the judicial system to be transparent and reduces its responsibility to society. Sometimes a court considers a stream of seemingly similar cases, especially without thinking about their meaning and convincing position of the prosecution. And it can be even worse - the judge copies the sentence already quashed by the higher court, or stamps the text from the indictment, the investigation said. The most revealing in terms of the coincidence of the texts of judicial acts were poppy cases: in them the actors behave in exactly the same way. In particular, the accused enter the trade pavilion for poppy seeds and the store for solvent. Then, as the judge writes each time, they get a narcotic drug from this confectionery poppy - poppy straw extract, and the same day a police officer comes to them and notices the fact that the drug was made, Novaya points out. In Tuymazinsky district court, journalists found 16 cases with an almost identical decision. Almost all cases with matching fragments take place in a special order, and the accused, as a rule, fully admit their guilt. Moreover, it is impossible to understand from the text of judicial acts whether a person committed a real crime and whether investigative work was conducted to prove his guilt. None of the stamped cases indicated the reasons for the appearance of the police in the apartment of the suspects, and in half the cases there are no signs of examination to prove the drug intoxication of the suspect. In addition, it is not clear from judicial acts how to make a drug from a confectionery poppy, while, according to some reports, merchants sell a drug from Kazakhstan under the guise of a confectionery poppy. It turns out that the judges, copying the decisions, devalue the work of the operatives who identify drug dealers. Having studied all the available criminal sentences of district courts for 2017 and 2018, among the 780 thousand judicial acts, journalists found 50 thousand of those that have more than 80 borrowings. We are talking about judicial acts written by the same judge. The leaders in the written-off decisions were sentences on non-payment of funds for the maintenance of children or disabled parents, evasion of military service, provision of services that do not meet the safety requirements, narcotic affairs. Journalists of Novaya also compiled a rating of judges whose decisions most often coincide. These are the chairman of the Volga regional court of Kazan Rinat Safin (122 duplicates of 200), the chairman of the Ulan-Ude Railway Court Pavel Semashka (111 of 179), Natalya Oloeva from the Soviet district court of Ulan-Ude (79 of 282). At the same time, stamping cannot be called a characteristic of the judicial system of the Russian Federation as a whole: some courts copy decisions more often, others less frequently. The leader is the Vyborg District Court of St. Petersburg. In general, journalists divided the Russian regions into two types - in some judicial acts they copy much more often than in others. Experts consider a copied solution if it repeats 80 percent or more of the text. According to sociologist Kirill Titaev of the Institute for Law Enforcement at the European University in St. Petersburg, it follows that sentencing in a criminal case, convicting a person is a routine for judges. A less individual sentence is always less accurate, and less accurate is always less fair, investigators say. The stamping of court decisions may indicate systemic problems of the judicial system: workload of employees, the habit of the court to trust the prosecution, the lack of effective protection of the social lower classes. However, in any case, mass copying reduces the transparency of the judicial system. More details: ",0

" More and more people in the world are switching to vegetarianism and veganism, abandoning animal products. You will not see anyone with this, but recently animal defenders are increasingly proposing to change the diet of cats and dogs. If a person became a vegetarian this is his choice, but what about pets? Is it humane to forcibly change the usual diet of our pets? Opinions were divided on this point. Some supporters of plant nutrition are confident that in this way they save the planet, but veterinarians strongly disagree with them. Doctors believe that converting carnivorous pets to plant foods is cruelty to animals. If you deprive a cat or dog of animal protein, the pet will not receive all the vitamins and amino acids necessary for health. Maybe you will save the planet, but you will destroy your four-legged friend. Veterinarians explain that vitamin D is not synthesized in the skin of animals under the influence of ultraviolet radiation, so they should receive it with food. But a pet needs vitamin D3 found in animal foods, not plant-based vitamin D2. The same can be said about the other elements necessary for the health of tetrapods: calcium, phosphorus, iron and amino acids. Trying to put a cat on a vegan diet is like feeding a horse meat. You want to force the animal to eat food that it was originally not adapted to, according to its species characteristics, said Lew Olson, Ph.D., author of Raw and Natural Dog Food. Despite the protests of experts, the trend of moving pets to a vegetarian diet is becoming stronger. Canadian scientists decided to collect statistics, and it turned out that out of 3,673 owners of dogs and cats, 6,2 turned out to be vegetarians, but only 1 of them excluded meat from their dog's diet. For supporters of a more strict diet, vegans (5.8, or 212 people), this figure was significantly higher: 27, that is, 58 animals, were deprived of the products that they laid by nature. 78 interviewed vegetarians and vegans admitted that they would like to transfer their pets to plant foods, but do not know how to properly balance their diet.

Anyone close to science knows this. They did not corrupt our children, but it all started with their filing. It was the reluctance of Jews to assimilate, their traditions to create communities and corrupt hierarchies in business that led such areas as media journalism, etc. to become completely infected by their people, from where they began to promote their exciting ideas about the people on whose land they live and do not want to assimilate, you see, should become more tolerant.

" you fucking troll chtoli or just mixed up dvachki and fucking dead end? Yes. I went here, fucking, with answers to a thousand words to prate. Debs fuck, if I was trailing I would just post anime smag faces. It always works. fucking excuses for any commie, especially such a dumb one like you, stas and the messenger of dope. Justification WHAT? It is necessary to be justified for misconduct. The ideologies of communism do not mean that you have to crap and give out all the money received by the capitalist way in the capitalist system to people living in the capitalist system and who will spend it on capitalist needs. To begin with, the fact that COMMUNISM means refusal of money as it is. You consider the communists to be some kind of many-maniac fucking because of the anal force on all sides. But no, my friend, the communists are materialists and logicians, the communists are realists. It is perfectly clear to everyone that in the modern world one cannot survive without money and that helping the units will not change anything. Communism is based on rationality and implies that it is beneficial to the Communists themselves. The rejection of everything in the capitalist world - fucking is not profitable. It is more profitable to use these resources for the spread of communism. So here. Nowhere, fucking, it is not said that a communist should live in shit, eat a beef anus and give out all the money. A communist must spread the ideas of communism so that people become communists. That is the point. And Stas does it. so why didn’t come back to be more significant? oh yes, 700k a month from his own words from the bakery and the sale of cell phones do not fall, and the salaries of his wife and sidekick must be paid Well, yes. He liked working at the bakery, but there is a salary of 20k. And here he makes videos and gets 700k. Once again, my friend, communism is not about the IDEALISTIC REFUSAL OF EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD. Communism is about materialistic and logical justice. The ideas of communism and Stas are that those who make videos get 100k and those who work at the factory get 100k. Then he will return to the factory. Conditionally. Naturally, he is against anyone even making videos on YouTube and living off of this. Again. The essence of communism is not to eat beef anuses for the idea, but to ensure that the world is fair, and you would not have to eat them because the oppressor decided to buy a black game tanker. at the word to dispossess himself, Stas substitutes for the ass, he thinks that means a little different. Stas imagines that he will give his studio, his channel and go to work at the plant for decent money. Like the whole country. What did you mean? and the first state with a communist system killed a bunch of people. Again, you start the funny stories about a billion babies raped and killed personally by Stalin? How many people were killed by the communists? 300k of the White Guard, 50-70k of the rebellious peasants. All. The White Guard is not people at all, but the peasants, yes, sorry, they had to voluntarily dekulakize. All these awesome tales about the gulags and the famines have already been broken 1000 times on YouTube. Check channels of Syomin, Tube and Herald of the Storm. computers can serve not only to play DotA2, but also to build communism - yelling so far. What's so funny?

" Rosstat compared the level of happiness: feelings, health and social behavior. The proportion of single people is noticeably higher among people with low incomes. Rosstat conducted a study of behavioral factors affecting the health and social well-being of Russians. The survey results leads RBC. Approximately half of the low-income Russians 47 reported that they feel a sense of loneliness. Moreover, the proportion of women feeling loneliness is almost one and a half times more than men. Among high-income Russians, only 16.7 said they felt lonely. The share of respondents with average income experiencing loneliness is more than 23.8. Anxiety about the future is more often experienced by low- and middle-income citizens of 70 respondents. Among wealthy Russians, there are 23. Most high-income Russians believe that having children is without a doubt (45.2). Among citizens with middle and low incomes, there are less than 39.3 and 29.6. Percentage of respondents who believe that they should not have children among low-income citizens 22. The diet of low-income citizens most often includes potatoes (85.6), bread (83), cereals and pasta (82.8), dairy products (72.6). Middle-income Russians eat meat products (87.4), fruits and vegetables (83.8), potatoes (83.8) and bread (79.1) daily. For high-income citizens, the main daily products are fresh vegetables and fruits (87.6), meat (87.3), dairy products (74.5), cereals and pasta (74.8) and fish products (71.4). The incidence among citizens with low incomes is higher than with middle and high incomes. For example, hypertensive or coronary heart disease is twice as common among poor people as among high-income Russians. Alcohol consumption is almost independent of income levels: 77.3 people with high, 83.1 with middle and 80.5 with low income. The Rosstat study was conducted in October 2018 in all regions of Russia.

Washington intends to declare Brazil the main strategic ally among non-NATO countries, and admits the possibility of Brazil's membership in the alliance. This will greatly enhance security and cooperation between our countries, the American leader explained. In addition, Trump supports Bolsonar’s desire to join the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. According to the American leader, relations between countries have never been so close. Earlier, Bolsonaro called for clearing Brazil of dirty leftist views. It was noted that the trip of the Brazilian leader to Washington should demonstrate the commitment of the South American country of the United States, which is a deviation from the country's traditional diplomatic line. Bolsonaru became president of Brazil on October 28, 2018. He noted that he plans to change the direction of the country's movement and move closer to developed economies, rather than regional allies.

And I was flooded! But there is an arrow crap. Aluminum, and the trident is small. And I will hunt big fish, whale! He made an arrow from a steel bar, flattened the end with a hammer on a vice. Sharpened turned out to be a real Native American arrow with notches. But the summer is still far away. I'm watching TV. Winter is in the yard. The shotgun lies on its knees, sand hit it in the summer. And the fuse creaks when you twist it. Sand got into the mechanism. He also rusted. I put in an iron arrow. He pulled on the rubber. Good gun! Put on his knees. And I move the safety slider back and forth, working out the sand. The arrow is watching TV. I feel sorry for the TV. Yes, even the people in the room. Therefore, with my left hand I close the arrow. And watch a movie. I stick a fuse there. Trigger I do not touch nothing to fear. But here is a slap! And the arrowhead sticks out from my side of the palm of my hand. Shit! He pulled an arrow out of his hand. The smooth edges of the white meat looked at me. Nothing scary. Running to the washbasin. He put his hand in the water. And then a fountain of blood surged. The wash basin is filled with blood. The face in the mirror turned white. His eyes darkened with horror. Bandaged.

I did not understand the argument about the ghost of advertising. It's funny about bloggers - it’s not a pity at all, most of the content is not done in essence. The third.

If you need to go through such a place, I carefully weigh my strengths, if I see dogs that are not large, full of stones and it is advisable for me to cut it off, I will go through. If the dogs are large, there are a lot of them and there is no trash at hand - I won’t go. Simple rules and since then the dogs have not bitten me. Usually dogs simply guard the territory. Moreover, the same barking flock is usually aggressive on its territory and cowardly on someone else's. There are times when dogs with hunger try to hunt. Usually it is in the winter, when there is nothing to eat. We understand that I treat them, but naturally there should not be a hunt for people. So these dogs need to be removed from their free habitat. How should this work? 1. Noticed a new pack of dogs at home - a call to the police, to the catch service.

Income on 2-personal income tax about 60t.r. per month, payment - 22t.r. I think if unused credit cards were considered as a valid loan, figs with such initial data would have approved the mortgage. So I doubt that in the original story the refusal was only due to a freshly issued credit card. ",0

" The issued credit card is considered as a potential loan and accordingly reduces solvency. The TS in the comments laid out everything very clearly, even nothing to add. But in the text we are talking about the amount of a mortgage of 1 or 2 million, it follows that the confirmed income is not very high. At high incomes, they usually approve of 5-6 million (as the maximum possible transaction amount). It turns out that if the credit card was not for 10 tr, it could well have affected.

" With such success, you can buy a handset for 20 thousand, which is already more powerful than this Samsung, but does not have wireless charging, and what is the point of overpaying for it 8-10 rubles? The point is that there are no competitors to the c8 camera at this price (30k). All honors, siaomi and others at this price shoot worse, especially in the dark. It is useless to argue with this, on galaxies the cameras are polished to a shine and they shoot perfectly. Moisture protection, wireless charging, chips like a retina scanner, heart rate monitors, etc. For some, this is pampering, for whom it is necessary things, but the fact is that all this is in this phone and what is in View 20, except for the processor and a 48MP camera, which again shoots no better than c8? What can I say, in this honor there is not even optical stabilization, and this is for 38k. Why give 38k? For an 8nm processor and look at points in antitude? The practicality of wireless charging is that if you need to take the phone, it is interrupted or it is convenient. Well, the wire has not been canceled. But let's say in the car, instead of constantly clinging to unhook the cable, you can just drop it and that's it. It’s worth taking advantage of this and then this is wildly lacking, from which I conclude that you simply did not use wireless charging on an ongoing basis. ",0

But the certificate does not indicate that it was bought at a huge discount, and the person will think that the full amount will be returned to him. Although Moscow received the money for this certificate (I don’t care in which Muhosransk the salon itself is, the site is Moscow, they take 50 of the amount).

If any personal correspondence falls into such a logger, or even someone, in the absence of the user, reads his contact information, and divulges or otherwise uses the information received. Yes, even if you simply read correspondence with his friends or relatives, it is possible (but not necessary) to classify it as a violation of the secrecy of correspondence and intrusion into personal life. I repeat that such a situation with a very low probability will go into investigative measures. But if it does, it’s a violation of the constitutional article. With all that it implies, in the form of a statement, the seizure of the PC for investigative actions, attempts to extort from the security forces, and other unpleasant things.

Do you think this will not affect the price of electricity for people? So while it is a small percentage everything is ok. The effect on the price is negligible. Yes, and if it was not unprofitable, it would not have been sponsored by the state in other countries. That is, it clearly comes out more expensive. You can even calculate the profitability of panels and their payback at your own tariff for your home. And now subtract 20-30 percent from the cost and recount again it will be the price of the wholesale purchase of electricity. We have a bit of the wrong latitude that would be a big use with SES. Once again, I will repeat without capacious batteries a little from the SES.

Planning was a sign of socialism in Soviet times, although the States themselves used planning to the full, especially in the space program. In the United States, planning was partially used to stop the effects of capitalism (as well as elements of socialism, by the way). But socialism, planning is used in large quantities, China uses it as a normal communist country - wherever it can. The Chinese then also need to hurry. The United States has clearly decided to deal with China, and Trump’s second term will probably be the time to begin active actions. And where in a hurry. In a crisis with the United States, they will collapse and go over to socialism, like the USSR under Stalin. China has a solution, unlike the United States. ",0

I compare today's time with the beginning of the Middle Ages in Europe. By my analogy, we are now somewhere in the 5th century AD, in the last years of the life of the ancient Roman civilization. The events taking place then also seemed to contemporaries the end of the world. Civilization has fallen to become compost for the next civilization.

Boch with her with a picture in the new UI, you can get used to it. I do not like how the characters are radically changed. The characters were not given to the tribes, but protruded more strongly. If you look at all the series of old IAs, the difference in characters is noticeable. Ponka was made a zakas under the Mabel of Gravity Falls, so tear it and throw it away, since the girl-sweetheart in modern Western society to be low. The same is true with Miss Clue - a flat terminator babe, a strong independent woman, I’m not your secretary and the like, instead of a caring maid-grandmother, who, in moments of danger, showed her strong qualities. Scrooge in the old UI was insanely greedy only in the first Istria of the Treasure of the Golden Suns (series 1-5), at the end of which he admitted that the greatest wealth was the family and more than once sacrificed the loot for the sake of loved ones. If you remove the thread of greed at all, it will no longer be Scrooge. He was also written from Ebenezer Scrooge from Christmas History, in one of the Disney adaptations of which he was subsequently assigned this role. Well, and another moment, not connected with perception in any way, more related, rather, to canonicality. The first UIs are drawn in such a way as to be stylistically similar to the original source - comics authored by Karl Barks. But what UI 2017 is like, I wrote above, it seems. On Gravity Falls. A cross-sectional storyline is good (in old UIs from the second season they were also), but secondary in drawing (read so cheaply) and copying images of heroes are not buzzing, IMHO.

" No matter how, dear friend. There are radical fucking feminists - they show saggy boobs and draw posters where they stand on a mountain of men. And there are feminists of a healthy person - these are people who are trying to convey to society that a girl, if she wants and knows how, can do some work at the same level as a man and the point here is in education and abilities, and not that in a person between the legs. They are trying to convey to society that if a 12-year-old girl was raped and killed in the courtyard of her own house, then it was the fault of these adult men who molested and killed the child, and not the girl, that she went one way from the house to the store in jeans shorts, and thereby provoked them. A lot of the aspects for which they are fighting work in the opposite direction: if a man wants to be a teacher or a dancer - let it be, this or Musha praessia - go fuck. People need to be treated as they deserve, and not as society has decided by looking at their gender. That's what adequate feminism is about, not about changing endings. ",1

At the same time, the suppliers of raw materials went crazy: planned reserves were not enough, they gave everything to the production leader, the remaining areas were left without raw materials. OTK has withdrawn from processing, because there were no resources laid down to control over-planned production. Warehouse - that just winged everyone in pure French (Purquois, Michelle ?!), because there was no space for over-planned products. Salesmen simply do not understand where to put it all. That is, the entire logistics and production chain has gone ... across the furrow. I just see production as a chain of interconnected processes, as a system. Did you work directly in any production? And a malfunction in one of the elements of the system leads to failures in the system as a whole. I agree, but there is a nuance: what you described can only happen with total hollowing and inability to even organize minimally. If there are 15 blanks that need to be done per shift, and they were done in half a shift ... the machine will be readjusted to the next part or it will stand. One of the principles of modern organization is to do as much as necessary. Although you remake the plan three times, no one will customize the details more than necessary. Therefore, in the system as a whole, the editorial will not lead to malfunctions in principle, if he does not make a marriage. P.S. The system of advanced workers was relevant when it was extinct and above that where there was still the opportunity to really do much beyond the norm. Now almost any movement in normal production is optimized at the implementation stage, and the main goal is to reduce all kinds of costs and damage. ",0

It is understandable why, because he wants to earn more, and will do so for now. And yes, if a developer gets more money, this is good for the user. Good studios go bankrupt, introduce lootboxes, tear down DLC games, release mobile phone games instead of normal platforms, precisely because investors require more income from them. Games cost 60 bucks, like 10 years ago, and game development has become much more expensive and larger. How much time the game will bring depends on how much time will be spent on developing the next one and what developers will be forced to do. It’s strange not to understand this. Again, citing the console as an example: exclusives have significantly more favorable conditions and are actively supported by the platform. And what do we have in the end? The PC whines about the fact that the single games are extinct, some battered and other sessions, etc. On consoles, meanwhile, for the year Detroit, Horison, Spider Man, Year of Var, DDR ...

" Has it begun? 2018, the infamous corruption fighter from Bashkiria, who gave his beloved Mercedes a road and, as a result, lost his job, faced a new scourge. It turned out that the former policeman has a lot of elite property and now the prosecutor's office is petitioning for its confiscation. The servant of the law, who received about a million rubles a year, could not explain the origin of his property. The prosecutor's office in Bashkiria filed a lawsuit with the court about confiscating the property of Yuri Vorobyov, the former head of one of the departments of the department of economic security and anti-corruption (UEBiPK) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the republic. Already dismissed from service and in a pre-trial detention center on charges of misconduct, Vorobyov is now at risk of losing everything he has acquired in recent years. The cost control carried out by the regional Ministry of Internal Affairs established that Vorobyov in 2013-2017 with an annual income of about 1 million rubles. acquired a two-story residential building with a spa complex in a pine forest in the suburbs of Ufa, 2 expensive Range Rover Evoque, Mercedes-Benz GLA 250 4 MATIC cars, as well as 2 non-residential premises in Ufa, the republic’s prosecutor’s office said. As specified in the press service of the department, he tried to hide his income. In particular, the police registered all the real estate for elderly parents, Range Rover was registered for his ex-wife, and Mercedes was issued for Artyomova, Vorobyov’s second wife. At the same time, he himself drove a BMW for 5 million, which was issued for a certain legal entity, said the supervisory authority. Given the inconsistency of the expenses of the Ministry of Internal Affairs employee for the acquisition of the said property with a total value of over 24.7 million rubles (with a market value of more than 42 million rubles) to the proceeds, the republic’s prosecutor’s office filed a lawsuit in the Ordzhonikidze District Court of Ufa on the transfer of the above property to the income of the Russian Federation, ",0

" Glad you accept the benefits of marketing. The fact of the matter is that marketing is much wider than many people think of it, and it is almost everywhere in the modern world. Yes, many people use it for other purposes or abuse it, but this does not make marketing itself something terrible. A marketer works for profit, quite right. But the main and basic principle of marketing is to ensure that the customer is satisfied. Then he will a) tell his acquaintances (marketers have nothing to do with it), b) will use other goods or services of the company, c) will return again if he needs the same goods. The point is that marketing was not created to make life difficult for you, or to spoil it. And especially not to try to sell you what you do not need. In addition to what people need, there is also what manufacturers need suppliers. People need everything for free, but it's impossible. The task of marketers is to make people fit so that they are willing to pay an acceptable price for both parties. A marketer cannot take into account the preferences of only one side, this is impossible. You took a credit card because it is convenient - without visiting the bank. This is a marketing tool. And because the conditions are good in one bank - a debit credit. And because you trust Tinkov (like conditions, company, etc.). All this is the result of the good work of marketers. Now the discount card is obvious. But it is also a tool that marketers have come up with to keep customers and make them permanent by offering discounts and best prices. From the fact that everyone around uses, for example, mobile phones, they have not become useless and have not depreciated. They have become a natural, but still very important invention. The same applies to discount cards, only they, of course, are not so significant. Google is generally the 100th embodiment of advertising and marketing) The search engine was created in order to promote services, companies, products and places. Moreover, even free promotion and issuance options are the result of good marketing. Search engines evaluate how much you like a particular site, and give it priority. And in order for you to like a product company’s website, its marketers should take care of this and offer you something cool, suitable and at the appropriate price. Wherever your mother finds workers, I am sure that she did this without standing on the street with a banner in her hands. In any case, she took advantage of some kind of advertising channel. And even more than that - finding a product or service is not all. Conditions must be suitable. And for this, the supplier (workers) needs to know such things as: a) the average cost for the market and competitors (the market is different everywhere), b) the category of the customer (for oligarchs one rate, for ordinary people - different), c) offer what- then the guarantees, services, etc. that you needed at that moment. And much more. This also applies to marketing. Work - You are very lucky to have been recommended. But if you searched through sites, you would also use advertising, because sites would be found on the Internet, and the principles of marketing, as well as the entire labor market, also operate on the sites themselves. It is necessary to offer skills, abilities, principles, experience. At the same time, someone can go to the office in a certain part of the city, but someone can’t. From all this, the employer chooses who will offer the best conditions, for less money. This is also competition and marketing, to one degree or another. Marketing is useful. But the bottom line is that some use it incorrectly, badly. From the fact that the same advertisement will be shown 10 times to one person it will not become more relevant, this is a fact. It will cause only discontent and rage. But here the fault is not marketing and advertising, but those who set it up. As, for example, the printing industry as a whole does not get bad, simply because the posters printed. And advertising does not get bad because someone printed bad ads that you don’t need. Rather, it’s just the same example of a lack of marketing in general - no one has studied your preferences, demand, budget, etc. You just stupidly show again and again, hoping that you change your mind. This is not marketing, it is its complete absence. ",0

There is a certain number of orders from each district, the average value, say, 15 orders per hour. To satisfy them, you need 10 cars in the area. It remains 2. The system believes that 2 cars will not cope, sets the multiplier. But the actual number of orders can be even lower than the average, for example, only 5. And now this situation - you are standing in a rose from the same free cars and, according to the law of meanness, those rare orders that arrive, arrive not for you. only a systematic repetition of such a situation in different conditions (time of day, location, weather, day of the week) can cast doubt on the effectiveness of the system ",0

The hotel owner, without a moment's delay, takes a bill and runs with her to the butcher to pay back a debt of $ 100 for meat. The butcher, with a bill in his hands, runs to the farmer and gives him a debt of $ 100 for beef. The farmer repays the debt to the owner of the car repair shop, who wrote down 100 bucks for him to repair the car. The owner of the workshop goes to the local store and gives $ 100 for the products that he borrowed. The store owner runs to the local girl escort service, which, due to the crisis, served him a loan. The girl immediately goes to the owner of the hotel and gives him 100 bucks for the rooms, which she rented for clients, also on loan. At this moment, the tourist comes back down and says that he did not find a suitable room, takes the deposit and leaves. Nobody received anything, but the whole town now lives without debts and is optimistic about the future ... ",0

" Drain into the network, a moot point, because if I remember correctly, for a watt it turns out only about 5 cents? At a price of about 20 cents per kilo-watt consumed during the day, you need to earn 4 times more than you consume in the dark? About air conditioning, I understand that everyone decides for himself the necessary level of amenities, but I would definitely put in such a climate, so in my house it would be an extra item of electricity costs and, accordingly, more consumption. But this is a matter of tastes. I didn’t know about water. Thank. It is economically possible for California, but we have a small problem in Finland, electricity prices are driving ahead at an unrealistic pace, for example, 2014 4.56 2015 3.42 2016 3.84 2017 4.24 2018 6.70 without VAT and shipping costs. As can be seen from 2017-2018, the price jumped 58. The cost of delivery here also flies up in big leaps in view of the new law, according to which electric companies must ensure a continuous supply of energy to customers even in hurricanes and snowfalls. And this is problematic because the lines run along the forests and falling trees create a problem. We decided to bury the wires. Finland has a large area and mileage is not small, so the costs are not small. The companies decided that naturally the cost of bonuses for superiors and so on will not be reduced, but simply the costs will be thrown to customers. The price of delivery will go up for about 5 years at 10 per year. Already today, a delivery bill is more than a consumption bill for many. Although there is less sun, but the calculations are already worth doing, because if not today, then tomorrow it will already be possible to start saving. ps And I can and so and so, it all depends on the interlocutor, if there are numbers, knowledge of the case and the manner of communication, that is, what to discuss, and if I answer in the right and you are a sucker, then there will be no discussion, so , let’s say, our feelings are mutual.

So here it is not a fact that there is a correct answer, just facts, an understanding of the interlocutor’s thoughts, emphasizing interesting facts, such as about water and just a third-party look at the problem, and all this always leads to new knowledge that will be useful in life.

The cat had a belly ripped open, it crawled away from people, it hurt. Barely got out from under the car. He died on the way to the clinic, there was already agony. His death was painful. Near at the place where this cat was taken, lay the corpse of another gnawed cat. Just the girls who threw a cry for help. He was self-walking with them. If they lead a new cat, then they will not be allowed to self-walk.

" If we talk about patterns, then we can consider people in the form of elementary particles, as in physics. Only interactions between them occur according to other laws. For instance. The higher the concentration of particles in one place, the more lonely they feel. In a sparsely populated village, people are more interested in each other's affairs and lives. There is no feeling of loneliness. You can consider this as a kind of attraction between particles in the field of mental space. At the entrance to a high-rise building, they often don’t even know the neighbors in the stairwell, not to mention the residents of other entrances. We can talk about the law of repulsion. Thus, when a certain concentration of human particles is exceeded (if I may say so), repulsion (if I may say so) acts. People litter completely calmly, lost their relationship. With the separation of human particles over a certain radius, the law of attraction in the psychic space applies. People think about other people and take into account the opinions of others, show interest in others. Like that. This is my theory. ",0

" Here it is important to understand for which feminism was invented and why it was needed initially. I’ll explain on my fingers: after the completed industrial revolution, the main trend in our world has become profit. The capitalists constantly came up with new methods to increase sales. By the second half of the 19th century, all standard techniques were exhausted. We have not thought of coproeconomics yet. And then it dawned on someone .. In those days, women had almost no rights, often could not inherit property and were engaged only in domestic work. The divorce procedure was difficult, and in the event of a divorce, the woman, as a rule, was left with nothing. But, if a woman receives all rights (including property), then in the event of a divorce, in fact, two new families are formed. This means that not one house is needed, but two, not one car, but two, two sets of any household utensils and so on. Sales volumes are increasing sharply, and from scratch. A woman is forced to go to work in order to further increase the income of the capitalist. That, in fact, was what feminism was invented for. All that is happening now is foam, vysery, absolutely senseless shit-mixing that has nothing to do with the original meaning of feminism. ",0

" At the trial on July 22, the chief of communications of the Western Front Andrei Grigoryev testified: The war took the Western Special Military District by surprise. The peaceful mood that reigned all the time in the headquarters, of course, was transmitted to the troops. The army headquarters were in winter quarters and were defeated, and, finally, part of the troops (Brest garrison) was bombarded in their winter quarters. And here is what they learned in the Baltic region. The district headquarters commission arrived in the heavy artillery regiment of the 16th Rifle Corps of the 11th Army, either on the 19th, or on June 20. The general who headed it ordered to remove the sights from the guns and hand them over to the district workshop in Riga, 300 kilometers from the location of the unit, for inspection and allowed the command staff to go to Kaunas and their families on a day off. True, the regiment commander, after leaving the commission, did not even think to carry out these orders. But in the howitzer artillery regiment of the 75th division of the 4th army, ZapOVo rolled on June 19, all optical instruments, right up to stereo tubes, were taken to Minsk. Naturally, they weren’t returned by June 22nd. Curious things were told in our time in an interview with the newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, Lieutenant General Sergei Dolgushin, who was a fighter pilot during the war. Their regiment was in ZAPOVO, the airfield was, consider, on the border itself, five kilometers from it. During the winter of the forty-first year, we mastered high-altitude flights, shot a lot on both the cone and the ground, and began flying at night. On May 10, our regiment was transferred from Lida to the Novy Dvor airfield, a little west of Grodno. In the north, the border with the Germans was fifteen kilometers. As soon as we landed, a fascist messer flew over the airfield at low altitude. Cheeky, even shook his wings. In clear weather, from a height of two thousand meters, we saw a German airfield clogged with different cars. We made a diagram, handed over to the headquarters. And on June 21, at six in the evening, having completed the flights, they received an order: to remove cannons, machine guns, boxes of ammunition from the planes and store all this in a warehouse.

My client was going to throw the OZK out of the project (and have a problem with the fire and generally get the fuck out of fire) because under them you need a UPS and an automation cabinet, which is expensive. The most energy-saving technology in our country is to provide nothing, because it is expensive. And it’s really expensive, with an unobvious repayment of money in the future. As long as our energy and human resources cost a penny, we will not see any energy-efficient technologies in widespread use. ",0
" Well, formally, they are not obliged to report the reason for the refusal, everyone understands that the refusal of the loan is due to the refusal of insurance, but they do not say out loud. I somehow tried to install an interest-free installment plan for 3 months in one green online store known in Ukraine. I collected a new computer, there was money, no problem, but then there was a wave of mining and the price of vidyuha bit. I thought, why not get vidyuha and interest in installments for 3 months, since they give it, I’ll calmly pay it out without any problems. Well, in general, I chose the whole gimmick on the site for payment, and Vidyahu and interest on installments. They call me, it means from the store and say Yes, yes, xalonsox, our green online store gives installments without a commission for 3 months, but we arrange it through the bank, I can offer you a loan (!!!) from such a bank. Then I freaked out, what kind of installment plan, I immediately decided to go into denial for myself, but decided to go to the end of the chain, to find out what the conditions would be). I say Excellent, I just have a salary account in this bank, come on. And then they say a phrase to me, right away, I’ll remind you, this is a store representative. Please note that the bank manager can offer you insurance services. The same phrase was sent in the letter of confirmation of the application for mail. In general, at the same time, while the vidyaha was still in stock, I popped up a new order and paid everything with a card (from another bank, by the way). I happily expect the delivery of new donkeys, after 3 days the call Hello, xalonsox, I am a representative of such a bank, we received an application (I didn’t cancel the old order) blah blah. In general, after asking how much I still have to pay for an interest-free (!!) installment plan for 3 months, it turned out that they could not get it without life and health insurance of the client (I had quite good health insurance at that time from the employer, but this the argument didn’t work) n, and there’s also a one-time fee for using installment payments n, and this is if the bank approves (I recall, the site is initially positioned as an installment plan from the store). Well, they hinted very opaque that when the insurance was refused, the bank’s chances of approval are extremely small. ",0

Why should I do the details in many programs, when I can quickly build a model in SolidWorks without any problems, cram it in the same 3D Max, apply textures and render, spending much less time on it than creating it in 3D Max from scratch? Unfortunately, we do not have digital production everywhere, so you have to make drawings. If we consider CAD systems with reference to drawings, then look towards Siemens SolidEdge, but not towards Compass and AutoCAD. P.s.

" 06/03/03-85, 2.05.02-85 Asphalt laying at low temperatures is carried out using cold mixtures. This is a polymer asphalt, modified with the help of special additives that give it plasticity, resistance to frost. According to existing technology, when using such a composition, the addition of bitumen thickeners is mandatory. Today, two types of cold mixtures are used: sand and fine-grained, fractions of 10-15 mm and 5 mm. This technology allows you to create an easy-to-use, durable coating that is resistant to the most extreme weather conditions. Despite the high cost of work, cold modified mixtures are increasingly used for many reasons. One of them is fast and high-quality laying of asphalt in rain, snow or at temperatures up to 60 degrees, which is simply impossible with other types of mixtures. And now please forbid SNIP) ",0

" I can explain on every point. Flour is a product with a high glycemic index. Like sweets, it quickly increases blood insulin. In his case, it is better to exclude rice (since it is polished and pasta), fatty is fatty meats, sausages, fatty cottage cheese, fatty milk, fatty kefir, vegetable oil. Only linseed oil. Fried - is it clear that it is impossible and harmful? Sweet drinks are very high in calories like sauces in which there is a lot of sugar and salt. All food should be as simple as possible, less processed and LICENSE. it would be nice to know the glycemic index of foods. For example, carrots and cabbage - eat raw as much as you like. Cook - and an index under 70-90 which means an increase in blood sugar. Oatmeal, buckwheat, barley, brown rice, vegetables, meat, fish, chicken without skin. Then you can turn on pasta from hard varieties ... Fruits are limited. Pomelo and grapefruit have a low glycemic index. The rescue. In general, as I said, we must weigh everything.

Now in many European countries, in the American stronghold of capitalism, there is some kind of social, but without all these fiery speeches and other Kyrly-myrli. Maybe, it would be worthwhile to contrast socialism with capitalism, and consider one thing to be completely correct, and something else to be completely wrong and that these things are incompatible. In the real world, the dichotomy of black and white does not work as a rule. Or maybe we have not just reached the level of development of society, when such a refined socialism-communism will work? After all, society is developing, the slave system was once the norm, feudal fragmentation.

And somehow during the conversation it turned out that there was nothing to bury me, there is nothing suitable. And it would be necessary to find in advance that relatives would not have even more worries. Therefore, it was decided to order a dress in advance, but for now, debts, things, documents should be put in order. It was winter, a week before the new year. The next day, brother asks if I ordered a dress. She replied that yes, and the swimsuit still snatched on the stock. Then he came up, why swimsuit? A swimsuit then that in the summer I will be sunbathing. By the way, a colleague asked me to sunbathe in Hell or what? .

" The benefits of donation are undeniable. In personnel donors, the frequency of cardiovascular diseases, in particular strokes, is significantly reduced, because there is an active renewal of blood. Our staff donors of both blood and plasma, especially men, are better protected from vascular catastrophes. In addition, any donation is, albeit mild, but stress for the body. And it is proved that the presence of just such mild stresses increases a person's resistance to the effects of adverse environmental factors. Thanks to donation, blood cells are regularly updated, because they also tend to age. Usually their natural recovery occurs, and in donors this process occurs with a greater frequency. There is such a theory that the female body is more resistant to negative external factors precisely because monthly blood loss occurs. Olga Mayorova: Donor blood is not a medicine; it cannot be bought at a pharmacy. Donation is very useful in the presence of a genetic disease of hemochromatosis associated with the accumulation of iron, the excretion of which is impaired. In the United States, half of the blood donors are people with this inherited condition. For them, one of the physiological treatments is bloodletting, which makes them physically easier. Another category is people with high cholesterol and plasma fats. Nevertheless, they know that in this case, plasmapheresis is used for treatment and prevention. In commercial clinics, this procedure is quite expensive. But not everyone knows that donor plasmapheresis is almost the same procedure. People who have crossed the 50 and 60-year age limits are very active in donating plasma simply because they feel good after that. Donation allows you to extend youth and lead an active lifestyle. Do not forget about the psychological factor. Donation is a confirmation of one's own significance, people experience great moral satisfaction. These are saved lives. In addition, donors are a specific club, especially plasma donors who arrive on the same days, at the same time. They make acquaintances, which is important given the current lack of direct communication due to the flourishing of social networks. By the way, if your loved one or just a new staff donor familiar to you of the opposite sex, then you can do anything with him, because he is obviously healthy. After all, being a donor with a frequency of 2 weeks, a person receives a check for the most complex and serious diseases. ",0

" By law, ships have the right to pass through the coastal zone of another country, unless its authorities have imposed a special ban. The FSB claims to have warned Ukrainian ships of the ban, but documents do not confirm this. If there were no prohibitions on November 25, Ukrainian ships could enter the 12-mile zone near the Crimea, and border guards should not detain them for this. So, according to Articles 21 and 22 of the Convention, the coastal state, if necessary, and taking into account the safety of navigation, may require foreign vessels (ships) Now we turn to Articles 21 and 22 (here you are most likely mistaken because Russia refers to Articles 19 and 21), there is a twofold answer on the one hand: However, the rules for crossing the sea border are different from the rules that apply on land. According to Articles 17 and 18 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, any ship has the right to peaceful passage through the territorial sea of ​​another state, without prior warning. Articles 19 and 21, to which Russia refers, contain the rules for peaceful passage. The main ship must follow continuously and quickly, do not go into ports and do not anchor, do not fish, do not conduct exercises with the use of weapons, and should not commit any act of propaganda aimed at encroaching on the defense or security of the coastal state. And yes, you can forbid any ship to sail to its water area, but it should not be sent to a guard ship, not the ensign from the boat to scream, but I quote. The coastal state can really temporarily suspend peaceful passes through part of its territorial sea, but such a decision takes effect only after it publication. In the Notices for Mariners And if you go deeper a little deeper then: Ukraine claims that it sent a notice of passage of ships and that the port's dispatching service refused to ensure the freedom of navigation guaranteed by international agreements. And here then the question arises, on the one hand, the right to free passage guarantees passage, and Russia could not ban it. On the other hand, whether this notification was sent or not, we won’t know. Ukraine says it sent Russia, it says it didn’t receive it. If it turns out that Ukraine sent but received a refusal, then Russia has problems. If it turns out that she did not send problems to Ukraine. But if it was a provocation, then she naturally sent such a notice and passed under the contract of 12.24.2003. Since according to this agreement they can pass without notice. ",0

" The most important area of ​​work of this healthcare system is the prevention of diseases, which is realized through the creation of medical units and health centers at various enterprises and institutions, the organization of mass vaccination of the population, as well as through active promotion of a healthy lifestyle and sports. Along with this, the Soviet government made significant efforts to create and develop the medical and pharmaceutical industries, as well as actively conducting research work for the needs of Soviet health care. For example, in the production of antibiotics, our country was in second place in the world, and in general it provided its own needs for medicines by more than 70 (the rest was obtained in cooperation with CMEA countries and from India). In addition, the Soviet Union not only supplied vaccines and raw materials for the production of drugs to the socialist camp allies, but also actively participated in the creation of the pharmaceutical industry in developing countries. In particular, with the help of the USSR, pharmaceutical factories were built in Iraq, an antibiotic plant, synthetic medicine enterprises, and surgical instruments in India. The Soviet health care system was officially considered one of the best in the world. Abroad, it is also well known as the Semashko system, named after Nikolai Alexandrovich Semashko, a revolutionary, doctor, academician of the Academy of Medical Sciences and the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences, who took the initiative to create a fundamentally new healthcare system, becoming the first people's commissar of healthcare. Various evidence of the concrete successes of Soviet health care can be cited for a long time. I will mention only single information. For example, the average life expectancy in the USSR was only for 1926 1972. increased by 26 years. The mortality rate in the USSR was the lowest in the world, lower than in the USA, England, France, Sweden. Moreover, with financing ten times less than, for example, in the USA, the economic efficiency of Soviet health care exceeded the efficiency of the American system by five times. These data are presented by an expert of the International Human Rights Committee, Professor O. Bobrov, and there is no need to doubt the reliability of this source. On the recommendation of the World Health Organization (WHO), the Soviet experience was carefully studied and used not only by the countries of the socialist camp, but also by the capitalist West. On January 23, 1970, the American LIFE magazine, under the heading Soviet medicine of 1970, published a series of articles with photographs about medicine in the USSR. Calling Soviet medicine the most nationalized in the world, LIFE noted with admiration then: everyone can get free medical care. From birth to death, a Soviet citizen is followed by a dossier on his health. He can receive preventive medical care without leaving his post or place at school, factory, farm or office. If he is sick, but can walk, he goes to the clinic - one of a thousand free infirmaries. the Soviet health system was recognized by WHO in 1979 as the best in the world ",0

" Very sorry for the niche. Today with a colleague it was just discussed. I am a marketer. I sincerely regret that most people have such a misconception about what marketing is. Meanwhile, this is a whole area, a whole profession. And its goal is not to give you shit at the price of chocolate. Marketing allows you to sell. In fact, no matter what. And the fact that unscrupulous shit sellers use it as a sales tool does not make marketing the way the TS described it in this post. This well describes modern sellers and their marketers (in quotation marks) who use marketing in order to sell this shit, and who forget that marketing is primarily a quality product that meets the needs of the target audience. The ability to offer what is needed to someone who needs it, and then when it is needed, and to make the client satisfied. As you can see - nothing to do with what the vehicle described. There are a lot of nonsense in marketing right now. As in design, and in business training. This is because these are professions that, at first glance, do not require special efforts and skills, and allow you to work in a free schedule, earning decently (in theory). It is because of them that many people have the idea of ​​marketing, as they describe it here. Alas and ah. By the way, for fun, try to imagine a world without marketing, competition or advertising at all. Only honestly, without any advertising, including native, word of mouth, as well as signs in the store. You will understand that it would be much worse than such a marketing. Rather, it would be completely impossible. Your friend’s recommendation in itself is an advertisement. When you choose the prices of goods, services are advertising and competition. When you look for the best solutions for your unique case and choose from different offers, and then find the perfect one - this is marketing. And without this, the modern world is hard to imagine.

" Questions: saw a couple of pictures of arkos knives, good ones? Do professionals use them? Why do you prefer the Germans? I always liked Arkos for its steel, it is unpretentious and holds sharpening well. Professionals use what they are given in the organization and sometimes buy it if necessary. You come to work in a workshop, and there everyone is given Vustkhov or Traumatin, you will work with them, they will give out Arkos, you will work with Arkos. If this is not super-intensive, professional work, then the knife is selected simply based on convenience. It’s just more convenient for me for the Germans to lie down in the hand of those Spaniards with whom they worked there were problems with the handles (you can see it in the photo), but the Germans don’t. At the same time, one must not forget that Arkos has a gigantic lineup, at one time they produced knives with wooden handles (very convenient). Pottery is not in use from the word at all? The advantages of ceramics are a great cut (high hardness, small sharpening angle) and the absence of oxidation from products. Cons - Price, fragility, difficulty in maintenance. In a boning, a ceramic knife cannot be used, it is a force load on the blade (the ceramic simply breaks). The same situation with the venation. I believe that this material will be finalized, but now the butcher does not need it. In the last photo, the third knife on the left (some kind of curve), why is this? For skinning. Slightly bent just so that you can use part of the blade to cut (scrap) the skins from meat. Most national knives (hunting) have a similar bend (the same Bowie or Pucco) for the same tasks. How long does meat carcass take? Does 1 person do this at all? Very general question. Beef carcass? The pork Lamb? Is parsing a complete deboning? Partial? For example. Beef is standardly considered quarter. Beef ass - 1 quarter, collapses in 3-4 minutes. But if the butcher is faced with the task of collapsing ten quarters, then the average time will increase. Again, the preparedness of the workplace affects. The front quarter takes longer to fall - the scapula - 4 minutes, the neck - 4 minutes, the ribs the neck part is thick and thin (the muscles running along the spine) are another 5 minutes. Everything on average, can be faster, can be more accurate and slower. Total approximately 25 minutes for a full deboning of a half carcass, 50 minutes for a carcass. Approximately the same amount of venation (that is, simply cleaning boneless pieces from connective tissue and portioning), respectively, 1 hour 40 minutes. One person can do everything and usually he does everything in small shops, another thing is that in order to speed up the process, specialization and division of labor must be introduced.

" Since April 1, five million Ukrainians may be left without water due to debts of water utilities. On Thursday, March 21, said the vice president of the Association Ukrvodokanalekologiya Olga Babiy at a press conference in Kiev, according to Ukrinform. The Association of Vodokanals decided to warn of the possibility of consequences. We are now talking about the fact that about five million people in Ukraine, if no one intervenes, will remain without water from April 1, ”said Babiy. She noted that from January 1, 2019, the Law of Ukraine on the electricity market came into force, which should destroy the monopoly of oblenergo on the supply of electricity. Therefore, water utilities could buy cheap electricity on the market. But, according to the new law, electricity is supplied under conditions of 100 prepayments for the service. And over the past five years, water utilities have accumulated debts for electricity consumed totaling six billion UAH. According to Babi, the debts of water utilities to energy supply companies arose because water prices did not take into account the increase in electricity prices, the cost of which for water utilities rose from 25 to 37. According to the requirements of the law, all water utilities, according to the new law, must conclude contracts for the supply of electricity in the free market. But when these enterprises began to conduct tenders for the purchase of cheap electricity, energy supplying retail companies did not come to tenders. They said: You are unreliable payers, you will not pay on time, ”said the vice president of the association. According to her, now about 30 water utilities that have not concluded an agreement receive electricity from the supplier of last resort, which was determined by the state enterprise Ukrinterenergo. But even Ukrinterenergo, many water utilities had a debt associated with the mismatch of water tariffs with new electricity prices. As you know, on April 1, the deadline for electricity consumption from the supplier of last resort expires, so water utilities can be disconnected from the electricity. This means a humanitarian catastrophe for more than five million people, Babi stressed. We demand that the NSDC be collected on these issues. An urgent need to extend the period of cooperation with the supplier of last resort for another three months. NKREKU should immediately establish economically feasible tariffs to ensure their activities. The government should allocate funds to cover the difference in tariffs from the state reserve fund, ”the expert summed up. ",0

" At least libertarianism does not die due to free-market laws. This is already something for me. By the way, in history there are very few examples of unsuccessful libertarianism (but there is a good one - the USA. Until they have spent their freedoms, really), but there are heaps of attempts to build communism. And it’s not that communism itself was bad, they simply build it by purely violent methods. By the way, now there are ankom communities: Niederkaoufungen, for example. In Italy and New Zealand, too, there are, but I don’t remember the name. Still, the Free State Project is stirring up something; the beloved Light Amish can be considered ankoms. The scale is small, but this already proves that at least the ankom on a small scale is more than viable. If a person acts according to the law and the constitution, then the violence committed by him is legitimate. But these laws are established by the state, alas. One way or another, it is it that controls the legitimacy of violence. and what will you do with the monopoly? A monopoly cannot exist in a free market, since a monopoly implies violence, and a free market is exclusively voluntary. And incredibly successful companies will be resolved by the market, since the larger the company, the greater the costs that a small business can profit from. And with such industries that ordinary capitalists will not cope with (for example, space)? But they can’t cope? Cope. Money is needed before a pussy, of course, but for this, capitalists can unite, fold into the common fund or collect voluntary donations from the population. By the way. Minarchism suggests giving up sophisticated industries like space and nuclear weapons to the state until the state dies. But the ideological minarchist is a fagot worm. In general, in a free market, a ferryman can simply unite with a business and receive a certain percentage. This will be a common and mutually beneficial enterprise, in which you do not have to forcibly collect taxes. Well, or the ferryman will gradually reduce transportation prices due to increased passenger traffic and the emergence of competitors if he decided not to cooperate with business. ",0

" DARPA Agency in 2020 plans to begin work on a nuclear missile engine. The task is to develop such an engine that could be used to move space transporters within the lunar orbit. The financing of the project is 10 million, and it is called ROAR (Reactor On A Rocket). The US military (in any case, those related to this project) believe that nuclear reactors will make it possible to establish an effective system for moving spacecraft. At the same time, the operating time reserve of the nuclear engine will be somewhat larger than the standard engines currently in use. The calculation is based on the fact that the flow rate of the working fluid will go slower. Well, as a working fluid they will use liquid gas, possibly hydrogen. The working fluid inside the engine heats up, there is an ejection through the nozzle, which moves the spacecraft forward. This makes it possible to significantly increase the efficiency of the use of nuclear fuel. In turn, this means that the size of the rocket can be reduced, and flight hours can be reduced. The fuel for the nuclear engine will be uranium, where the content of the U-235 isotope will be more than 5, but less than 20. Modern submarines with a nuclear reactor use highly enriched uranium fuel, the percentage of which is up to 90. But at the nuclear power plant, weakly enriched uranium is used (only 3-5). The development of a nuclear engine is scheduled for 2020 because up to this point it is planned to carry out a number of research projects. Some of them are devoted to the creation of technologies that are planned to be used in the reactor. The project can be represented as a Lego constructor, for which some of the elements are missing. Unfortunately, there is a start date, but the planned end of the project is not indicated so development can take many years. As for the idea of ​​using a nuclear engine in space, it does not belong to DARPA, but to NASA. The agency, together with several partners, has been developing since the mid-20th century. They conducted research on the creation of aircraft with a nuclear rocket launcher in the USSR. They did not receive development in either the United States or the USSR for three main reasons. The first is a high risk of an accident, which, provided there is a nuclear reactor on board, can lead to the most disastrous consequences. The second is purely technical difficulty in creating such a spacecraft. The third need is the creation of massive radiation protection for the crew. True, in the middle of the 20th century, developers tried to solve the problem of creating an apparatus that would rise from the surface of the Earth. Now we are talking about starting already from orbit. The spacecraft will be launched into orbit with conventional chemical-propelled launch vehicles. In principle, it is possible to create an apparatus that would start from the surface of the planet using nuclear fuel, but much more difficulties arise here than in the case of orbital operations. In addition, previously, scientists tried to create a nuclear electric propulsion system. In this case, the reactor generates electricity that is supplied to electric rocket engines (they can be plasma or ion). Now it is the nuclear rocket engine that is being developed, the working fluid of which enters the reactor, is heated and thrown out through the nozzle. Now the work is carried out by other organizations, for example, BWXT Nuclear Energy. This company is the successor to Babcock Wilcox, who built the world's first nuclear reactors and nuclear submarines. In recent years, the company's specialists have been studying the reliability of nuclear rocket engines. The advantage of a nuclear engine is also the fact that the design of the reactor reduces the amount of fuel needed to perform pulse maneuvers. The engine can be restarted several times. Cosmonauts will be in the compartment protected from radiation, of course, if we talk about manned spacecraft. DARPA is a very multilateral organization. So, recently it was reported that she was engaged in the development of artificial intelligence of a new generation. The agency believes that the new AI will be many orders of magnitude smarter than its predecessor, and the robot will reason based on common sense. Much more was invested in this project than in the nuclear engine, not millions of dollars, but 2 billion. Director of the DAPRA military science department Valerie Browning said: The super idea of ​​the AI ​​Next project is this: turn a car from a tool, sometimes very worthy, into a real partner, into an employee trustworthy.

" Rosstat reported a record industrial growth rate in Russia for almost two years, according to him, the output of industrial enterprises accelerated sharply from 1 percent in January to 4.1 percent in February 2019. The Rosstat’s calculations surprised economists, since the three previous months in the economy showed a gradual slowdown in industrial production. About this newspaper Kommersant. As the publication explains, the data from Rosstat do not meet the expectations of economists, or even survey leading indicators of the statistical department itself. Analysts, however, note that if seasonal and calendar effects are taken into account, there has been no increase in industrial production since the beginning of the year. The Higher School of Economics (HSE) made their own calculations based on crude statistics, took into account seasonal factors and came to the conclusion that in February 2019 there was no increase in the rate of industrial production in the Russian economy. The HSE explained that in February 2019 there was one more working day than in February 2018, hence the appearance of production growth. At the same time, the HSE noted that if the calculations still take into account the seasonal effect and calendar, then it turns out that industrial production for two months not only does not grow, but decreases noticeably. Rosstat has repeatedly been criticized for inaccurate calculations. So, according to the results of 2018, the department announced a growth of the construction industry in Russia by 5.3 percent, although back in November the annual growth rate was estimated at only 0.5 percent. These high indicators then allowed the Ministry of Economic Development to estimate GDP growth at the end of the year not by 1.8 percent, as predicted, but by 2. Analysts criticized these figures and found them fictitious. The methodology of Rosstat was also criticized by First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov, saying that the quality of the agency’s calculations is terrible, and the method is opaque. Since 2017, Rosstat has been subordinate to the Ministry of Economic Development, which is headed by Maxim Oreshkin. The department from 2009 to 2018 was headed by Alexander Surinov. In December 2018, he resigned, he was replaced by a former official of the Ministry of Economic Development Pavel Malkov. ",0

" The Ministry of Health named the main cause of death for men In the country and the world In the country, the Minister of Health Veronika Skvortsova named the main cause of death for men. She spoke about this at a meeting on the implementation of national projects Health and Demography, reports RIA Novosti. About 70 percent of deaths among working-age men are related to alcohol abuse. According to her, a huge resource for reducing mortality depends on the lifestyle of citizens. Skvortsova explained that the most vulnerable age category is people aged 50 to 60 years. So, Russians who have lived to 55 years old live on average 79 years. The easiest way to influence children who do not yet have a cumulative incidence is the age from 14-16 to 35 years. Then it’s a little harder, she said. According to the Ministry of Health for 2017, the basic mortality rate for men is 735 people per 100 thousand of the population. Within five years, Russia should reduce the mortality rate by one third. However, even in this case, Russian indicators will be twice as high as in the European Union, where 200-230 people die for every hundred thousand inhabitants. More than 40 percent of deaths in Russia can be prevented, the Minister of Health concluded. Earlier it was reported that the Ministry of Health has developed a bill banning the sale of alcohol with an ethyl alcohol content of more than 16.5 percent for people under the age of 21. It was also noted that over the past three years, the number of deaths from excessive alcohol consumption has decreased by two thousand. ",0

" Israel. Special forces of the army, the police and the SHABAK liquidated the Palestinian terrorist Amar Abu Lail, who attacked an IDF soldier at the Ariel intersection and then shot Rabbi Etinger. The IDF operated on the basis of point information on the whereabouts of the militant received from the Palestinians themselves. According to Ynet, after a three-day search, the special forces assault unit disguised as yellow Palestinian taxi passengers arrived in the village of Evelyn in the suburbs of Ramallah. When the fighters of the unit approached the house where the terrorist was hiding, he opened fire to kill from the M-16 rifle stolen at the site of the terrorist attack of a killed IDF soldier. Abu Layla was destroyed by sniper return fire. The search for militants' accomplices continues. His brother and father are arrested by Shabak. The Abu Layla family store in the Arab village of Bidia has been closed by decision of the authorities. Recall that the victims of the terrorist attack near Ariel were 19-year-old sergeant Gal Kaidan and 47-year-old rabbi Akhiad Etinger, father of 12 children. Recall: the son of repatriates from the USSR, Gal Kaydan died in a terrorist attack at the Ariel crossroads 19-year-old junior sergeant of the artillery unit Ash Gal Kaydan died in a terrorist attack at the Ariel crossroads, according to Ynet. Parents of the deceased Anatoly and Marina Kaydan repatriated to Israel from the USSR in the mid-70s of the last century, ITV Channel 12 reports. Another IDF soldier, who received a heavy gunshot wound to his stomach in a terrorist attack at the Gitai Avishar intersection, was transferred to the intensive care unit of Beilinson Hospital in Petah Tikva.

Guaido previously claimed that Marrero and opposition Venezuelan MP Sergio Vergara were detained by agents of the Bolivarian intelligence service and searches were carried out in their homes.

" In all reference books and textbooks it is stated that between two bodies having masses (m) and (M), an attractive force (F) arises, which is directly proportional to the product of these masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance (R) between them. This ratio is usually presented in the form of the law of gravity (picril). Let's use this formula to calculate what is the attractive force between the Earth and the Moon, as well as between the Moon and the Sun. To do this, we need to substitute in this formula the corresponding values ​​from the reference books: the mass of the Moon 7.3477 1022 kg the mass of the Sun 1.9891 1030 kg the mass of the Earth 5.9737 1024 kg the distance between the Earth and the Moon 380 000 000 m the distance between the Moon and the Sun 149 000 000 000 m The force of attraction between the Earth and the Moon 6.6725 10-11 x 7.3477 1022 x 5.9737 1024 3800000002 2.028 1020 H The force of attraction between the Moon and the Sun 6.6725 10-11x 7.3477 1022 x 1.9891 1030 1490000000002 4.39 1020 H It turns out that the force of attraction of the Moon to the Sun is more than twice (!) More than the force of attraction of the Moon to the Earth! Why, then, does the moon fly around the earth and not around the sun? Where is the agreement of the theory with experimental data? If you can’t believe your eyes, please take a calculator, open the directories and see for yourself. According to the formula of universal gravitation for this three-body system, as soon as the Moon is between the Earth and the Sun, it should leave the circular orbit around the Earth, turning into an independent planet with orbital parameters close to the Earth.)

Many times before this incident, NASA was accused of cheating and rumors circulated that there were no moon missions at all.

Also, a lot of controversy and controversy caused a picture with astronaut Eugene Cernan on the moon. The surface of the Earth’s satellite from the apparatus from China. On these frames, you can notice that the moon’s surface has a gray tint, while the spacesuit itself is quite bright and shown in real color.

" Pozner called the difference between Russians and Europeans Television presenter Vladimir Pozner believes that Russians differ from Westerners in their attitude to the law, namely in contempt for it when they achieve a high social position. The opinion of the journalist is given on the Posner Online website. Source: RIA Novosti. As an example, Posner cited the situation with a prestigious school near his home. After classes for parents of primary classes, parents come in cars, and stop in places where this is prohibited. In order not to pay a fine, they cover the plates with pieces of paper. Moreover, you know, now in Moscow, in the center of the city, a fine of five thousand rubles for improper parking, but for people who own such cars, five thousand rubles, is that for many Russians about five rubles, the TV journalist draws attention. Pozner observed a similar situation at the complex in which he plays tennis. Why are they standing? Well, because their owners consider themselves extremely important and therefore for them this law does not exist. For you and me there is, but for them not, the facilitator concludes. He believes that the attitude in which a person, becoming an important master, begins to despise generally accepted rules, and distinguishes Russians from Westerners. This is very characteristic of us and not at all characteristic of them, Posner concludes. In his opinion, it is precisely such important people who tell everyone else to abide by the law, while for them it does not exist. In October 2018, Posner said that the authorities who are not thinking about the consequences of what is happening are to blame for the high poverty level in Russia. ",1

The western part (two-thirds of the territory) was captured by Israel during the Six Day War in June 1967. In 1981, the Knesset of Israel passed the Golan Heights Act, which unilaterally proclaimed the sovereignty of Israel over this territory.

" Ukrainians are killing themselves: Suprun took a tough initiative to sell drugs without a prescription. The Ministry of Health of Ukraine is developing a law to protect Ukrainians from uncontrolled use of antibiotics. It is reported by TSN, referring to the words of acting Minister of Health Uliana Suprun. The State Service, at the request of the Ministry of Health, is developing amendments to the law in order to increase fines and criminalize the sale of medicines without a prescription. Today, for this violation, the pharmacy can only be fined 120 hryvnias. Due to the fact that for many years they used antibiotics incorrectly, now there are a lot of tuberculosis or other diseases that can no longer be treated with the same antibiotics, because there is already resistance to them, said Suprun. She recalled that at a meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers adopted a strategy to combat precisely antibiotic resistance. It is better that people could not have such free access, because in most cases it is not necessary to be treated with antibiotics when there is a viral disease ... And we must narrow down the reasons why we use them, ”the official said. ",0

" The embalmed bodies of North Korean leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il must be used as leverage over the current DPRK authorities. With this initiative, Japanese human rights activist Ken Kato turned to the UN, sending letters to representatives of the organization, writes The Telegraph. According to Ken Kato, the UN should stop the supply to North Korea of ​​chemicals used to maintain in good condition the bodies exhibited at the Kumsusan Sun Palace in Pyongyang. Kato believes that the components necessary for embalming are luxury goods, since they are not intended to improve the life and well-being of ordinary people in the country. I want to force North Korea to feed its people, instead of spending tens of thousands of dollars a year on the dead in the mausoleum, nuclear weapons or missiles, the human rights activist said. He believes that the ban on the supply to the DPRK of substances that prevent the bodies of former leaders from decomposing can weaken the influence of the current regime. In particular, this will show Pyongyang's dependence on foreign technology even on such an important issue for him. In this regard, Kato asks the UN to launch an investigation into the smuggling of chemicals into North Korea from Russia in violation of the ban on the supply of luxury goods. The fact that the work with the bodies of the leaders of North Korea is performed by Russian specialists from the so-called Lenin Laboratory in Moscow, Reuters reported on March 6. As stated in the material, the staff of this laboratory embalmed Vladimir Lenin in 1924, and after the death of Kim Il Sung in 1994, Russian experts visit Pyongyang about once every one and a half to two years and make sure that his remains do not decompose. Similar actions are carried out with his son Kim Jong Il, who died in 2011. The exact cost of embalming is unknown. However, based on Moscow’s data on the costs of maintaining the proper condition of Lenin’s body, this figure probably amounts to about 400 thousand dollars a year for North Korea. A March report by the UN says that currently about 11 million North Koreans (about 43 percent of the population) need humanitarian assistance, The Telegraph notes. ",0

" Bad news was voiced by the representative of the National Nuclear Safety Administration of China, Shirong Zhou, at the annual meeting of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission in Washington. Due to the breakdown of the main circulation pumps, the work of the third, the latest-built nuclear reactor AP-1000, which was just built by the Americans in China, has been stopped. Curtiss-Wright replacement defective supplies already shipped from USA. Only one fact will help assess the scale of trouble: a standard technology for replacing these units for the AR - 1000 does not exist in nature, since products weighing 91 tons, 7 meters high and 1.5 - 2 meters in diameter, are tightly welded to the steam generator using the technology for constructing the reactor (two to the steam generator). Accordingly, the MCP resource promised by the manufacturer is 60 years without repair and maintenance. However, this is the second failure of these MCPs in several months of operation. And the fifth, if we consider their replacement due to defects discovered during the construction phase of the reactor. Reactor physical launch took place on August 17, 2018. By November, it was already in commercial operation. Till today. The main lesson is that the superior performance of the AP-1000 published by Westinghouse has been largely exaggerated.

" Four powerful explosions thundered in Damascus. This was announced on Tuesday evening by the Israeli publication Nziv, citing the Syrian media. We can talk about another Israeli attack on Iran’s military facilities and Hezbollah’s groupings in Syria, including those located at Damascus airport. Information about the incidents was confirmed by representatives of the London-based Syrian Center for Human Rights Monitoring. They explained that nothing was known about the causes of the explosions. At the same time, it is noted that the Syrian air defense system launched anti-aircraft missiles in an attempt to repel the strikes. Previously, such actions were not successful in opposing Israeli raids. At the same time, the Syrian military called what was happening military exercises. Information about a possible Israeli attack comes amid a visit by Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to Syria. As Interfax reported on Tuesday, Shoigu conveyed a message from Russian President Vladimir Putin to Syrian President Bashar Assad. The Russian Ministry of Defense announced that the parties had discussed various aspects of ensuring security in the Middle East region and post-conflict settlement. From December to January, Israel launched four attacks against Iranian military installations in Syria, two of which were massive. The Israeli leadership has repeatedly stated its intention to prevent an Iranian military presence in Syria. Revenge on Assad on March 10 reported that Russia actually took complete control of the Syrian air defense system and airports. As noted, from now on, the Syrian authorities are actually forbidden to use air defense systems without coordination with the Russian command, and not a single aircraft in Syrian territory will fly into the air without individual approval by the military of the Russian Federation. It is assumed that by doing so Russia avenged Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the Iranian authorities for separate negotiations, while Moscow itself seeks to rely on the Syrian military loyal to it. This is consistent with previous reports that relations between Russia, on the one hand, and its allies in Syria, on the other, are rapidly deteriorating due to the distrust that the Assad family and Iranian authorities have in relation to Moscow. The information that Russia now controls the Syrian air defense system has not yet been confirmed by other sources. It remains unclear how in this context the situation will be with the S-300 systems deployed in Syria, which, according to the Russian military, should have hindered Israeli operations. Previously, conflicting information was received on this subject: on the one hand, Moscow expressed dissatisfaction with the qualifications of the Syrian military, who had not yet mastered the management of S-300 complexes; on the other hand, the Russian media wrote about their intention to deploy these systems in the spring of 2019. The decision to transfer the modern S-300 systems to the Syrian authorities after the Syrian military, aiming at an Israeli plane, accidentally shot down a Russian electronic reconnaissance aircraft with 15 military on board during indiscriminate firing of anti-aircraft missiles. Russia accused Israel of trying to cover itself with a Russian plane, despite the evidence provided to Moscow to the contrary. Israel has repeatedly proved that it can easily neutralize Russian air defense systems in Syria without any loss for itself: from December to January, Israeli aircraft carried out at least four attacks in Syria, including two large-scale ones, during which about ten Russian-made air defense batteries were eliminated , including the Russian Shell-S and the Chinese radar for detecting stealth aircraft. The latter, as expected, was eliminated by the latest inconspicuous F-35 fighter. ",0

" The joint Russian-American mission Venus-D will search for life in the clouds of Venus, told RIA Novosti a leading researcher at the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, co-director of the bilateral scientific working group on the project from the Russian side Lyudmila Zasova. Some kind of primitive life could well exist on the surface of Venus during the first two billion years after its formation, when the young Sun had lower luminosity and the planet could be in the so-called habitable zone, that is, at a distance from the Sun at which it can exist on liquid water planet, the expert said. According to her, subsequently, the greenhouse effect warmed up the surface, but primitive life could remain in the clouds. The scientist explained the US participation in a joint mission with Russia with considerations of economy and the experience of the Soviet Union, which made 10 landings on the surface of Venus. The expert also noted the political importance of the project. Zasova said that at present, scientists are ready to begin development work. As the main version of the mission, the creation by Roscosmos of an orbital and landing vehicle (with a life of two to three hours on the surface of Venus) and a small long-lived NASA station designed to operate on the planet’s surface for 60 Earth days is considered. To test the equipment of the station in Khimki (Moscow Region), a camera can be restored that simulates conditions on the surface of Venus. It creates a pressure of 100 atmospheres and a temperature of 500 degrees Celsius. The dimensions of the chamber are sufficient to test the entire landing apparatus, the expert said. Testing of the operation of individual mission instruments in the Venusian atmosphere is planned in the United States. To receive scientific information after landing on the planet’s surface, Russian (in the X-band radio spectrum) and American (Ka-band) ground-based receiving stations will be used. In addition to Russia and the USA, Japan, Italy and Germany can take part in the Venus-D project. If funding for the mission begins in 2019, the station may be launched, most likely, not earlier than 2027. In March, the President of the Russian Academy of Sciences announced, according to TASS, that the budget of the Venus-D mission is estimated at one billion dollars. Currently, in the orbit of Venus is only one operating apparatus Japanese Akatsuki. In 2020 and 2021, the European-Japanese station BepiColombo should fly past Venus. In addition, in 2023, India plans to launch an orbiting spacecraft toward Venus. Last summer, scientists from France and the United States explained the results of observations made by the Soviet station Vega-2 in the atmosphere of Venus. The sizes, mass and acceleration of gravity on the surface of the second planet remotest from the Sun system are comparable to those of the Earth. The temperature of the atmosphere of modern Venus reaches 750 Kelvin, and its gas shell is 90 times denser than the Earth. The planet makes a complete revolution around the Sun in 224.7 Earth days.

" by Ukrainian fascists The invention of Ukrainian fascism is a diabolical triumph of political strategists who managed to create the myth of Bandera, punishers and law enforcement officers and inspire its power and the notorious 96 population through television. For the whole of 2014, Russia, including President Putin, moved to live on television, in an endless series, in parallel reality, where fascists marched in Kiev, punishers shot down a Malaysian Boeing and crucified a boy in Slavyansk, while the West sponsored Maidan, planned to accept Ukraine into NATO and place the ships of the Sixth Fleet in Sevastopol. Characteristic is the use by Russian propaganda of the image of fascism as a synonym for absolute, final, evil, final dehumanization of the enemy. Fascism in the Russian discourse has the universal value of the Other, the entire newest Russian identity is built on the ideology of victory over Nazism. Ontologization of the conflict with Ukraine is taking place as a struggle between absolute good and absolute evil. The war of Russia in Ukraine is an example of pure negativity, based on a sense of own inferiority, and compensation for the inferiority complex of the elite in relation to the West and the population in relation to the circumstances of their own lives. The authorities cannot change Russia's role in the international arena with the help of soft power, high-quality economic growth, and gain respect and recognition from partners. The overwhelming majority of the population, locked up within the framework of the class system restored by Putin, is also unable to go beyond state paternalism (essentially class slavery) and social parasitism, the syndrome of learned helplessness. Symbolic compensation was the creation of a fictitious enemy in the person of Ukraine and the fictitious victories of the annexation of Crimea and the creation of the pirate republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. But in fact, Krymnash and the actual rejection of the South-East of Ukraine became the march of the losers. ",1

Since it is located on a GUGLOVSKY server, and is only built into the board, due to additional requests to third-party servers, the speed of work drops significantly. Digital captcha works from a script installed on the board server itself, so there is no need for any third-party connections.

The problem is compounded for those who do not have the fastest Internet, and sometimes it takes 4-5 minutes to solve this Google vyser to send a post written in 30 seconds.

" By 2014, as noted by journalists, Russian parts were officially bought by Ukraine, however, after the aggression of the Russian Federation, an import substitution program was introduced. The authorities reported that purchases from Russia had completely ceased, but they simply went into the shadows with the help of fictitious contracts with non-existent firms. According to journalists, the center of the deal was the shell company Optimumspetsdetal, and Gladkovsky's group transferred the money received into cash, which was spent on kickbacks to factories, bribes to investigative agencies, and luxurious life. Organizers of kickbacks and theft schemes on the defense industry had a subscription for immunity from law enforcement agencies, the investigation said. Read more here: ",0

" TASS, March 21. The Prime Minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, imposed on Thursday a ban on the circulation and operation of assault and semi-automatic rifles in the country. This is stated in an official statement released on Thursday and published on the website of the New Zealand government. On Monday, 72 hours after the terrible terrorist attack in Christchurch, the cabinet agreed to revise the law. Now, six days after this attack, we are announcing a ban on all military-style semi-automatic and assault rifles in New Zealand, the statement said. All types of semi-automatic weapons that were used during the terrorist attack on Friday, March 15, will be banned. It is noted that under the ban will also fall devices with which you can remake weapons in a semi-automatic military model, and large-capacity stores. In addition, the Cabinet of Ministers instructed to develop a scheme for the purchase of weapons of this type from its owners. Exceptions to the bill will be the use of weapons in farmer communities for pest control and sports competitions, as well as the wearing of semi-automatic and assault rifles by police officers and representatives of the country's armed forces. On March 21, at 15:00 local time (05:00 Moscow time), the government introduced transitional measures to exclude prohibited weapons from circulation. So, according to the statement, the owners of military-style semi-automatic and assault rifles can immediately hand over their weapons to the police, having previously warned about a visit to the station, before the announcement of the terms of the ransom.
